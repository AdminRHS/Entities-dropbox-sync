2. **Flexible Scheduling**: Discussion-based timing negotiation
3. **Rescheduling Accommodation**: Built-in process for interview changes
4. **Post-Delay Follow-up**: Maintains candidate relationships even with timing challenges

## Platform-Specific Best Practices

### PLATFORM: Instagram

**BEST PRACTICE 1: Use DMs for Initial Screening**

**Reason**:
- Creates informal, comfortable first contact
- Reduces barriers to candidate engagement
- Candidates already familiar with Instagram messaging
- Allows quick back-and-forth qualification conversations
- Higher response rate than formal application processes

**Context**: Workflow 2, Step 1-2 (Screening candidates responding to Instagram ads)

**Evidence**: Both Task Templates emphasize Instagram DM as primary communication channel for all initial interactions

---

**BEST PRACTICE 2: Provide Multiple Contact Options for Document Submission**

**What to Do**: When requesting CVs or documents, offer Instagram AND alternate platform (Telegram) options

**Reason**:
- Instagram file sharing can be unreliable for professional documents
- Gives candidates flexibility in submission method
- Reduces friction in document collection process
- Ensures document quality and deliverability

**Context**: Workflow 1, Step 6; Workflow 2, Step 3

**Evidence**: "Ask the candidate to submit their resume via an alternate platform (e.g., Telegram) if it hasn't been provided yet"

---

**BEST PRACTICE 3: Accept Video Business Cards as CV Alternative**

**What to Do**: Offer candidates option to submit video self-introduction instead of traditional CV

**Reason**:
- More engaging and authentic candidate presentation
- Allows assessment of communication skills and personality early
- Lower barrier for candidates without updated CVs
- Leverages Instagram's native video messaging capabilities

**Context**: Workflow 2, Step 3

**Evidence**: "Ask the candidate to share a CV or a video business card introducing themselves and summarizing their professional background"

---

**BEST PRACTICE 4: Use Conversational Scheduling Rather Than Calendar Links**

**What to Do**: Discuss interview timing through conversation rather than sending automated calendar availability

**Reason**:
- Maintains personal, relationship-focused tone
- Allows for flexible negotiation of timing
- Shows accommodation and candidate consideration
- Reduces scheduling friction through dialogue

**Context**: Workflow 1, Step 3

**Evidence**: "Discuss potential interview timings with candidates to identify a convenient slot. Offer alternatives if needed."

---

**BEST PRACTICE 5: Maintain All Coordination via Instagram Even When Using Other Platforms**

**What to Do**: Even when using Telegram for files or other platforms for interviews, return to Instagram for confirmation and next steps

**Reason**:
- Creates consistent candidate experience with single communication thread
- Prevents confusion about which platform to check
- Leverages Instagram's notification system for timely responses
- Maintains relationship continuity

**Context**: All workflows, all steps

**Evidence**: Instagram mentioned as tool in 10 of 11 total steps across both workflows

---

**BEST PRACTICE 6: Build in Follow-up for Delayed Candidates**

**What to Do**: If candidate indicates travel or delay, schedule follow-up contact to reconfirm interest

**Reason**:
- Maintains candidate pipeline even with timing challenges
- Shows recruiter professionalism and organization
- Prevents ghost candidates
- Respects candidate circumstances while maintaining process momentum

**Context**: Workflow 1, Step 7

**Evidence**: "If a candidate previously indicated a delay, follow up to confirm ongoing interest in the vacancy and potential readiness for the next steps"
