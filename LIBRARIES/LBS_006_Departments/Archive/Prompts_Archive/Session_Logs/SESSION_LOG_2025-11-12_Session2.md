## Pending Work

### Immediate Priority (Current Session):
1. 🔄 **Assess Video_008.md** - Determine status, format, taxonomy completeness
2. 🔄 **Add Video_008 to VIDEOS_INDEX.md** - Update all statistics again

### High Priority (Future Sessions):
1. **Video_007 Complete Taxonomy** - Extract 15-20 workflows (2-3 hours)
2. **Video_005 Tech Stack Processing** - Catalog 40+ tools (2-3 hours)

### Medium Priority:
3. **Video_003 Processing** - Kimi K2 model documentation (1.5 hours)
4. **Video_004 Processing** - Browser automation patterns (1.5 hours)

### Low Priority:
5. **Video_002 Completion** - Phases 6-7 only (30-45 minutes)

**Estimated Total Remaining Work:** ~10 hours

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Video_006 Marked as "Taxonomy Complete" vs "Complete"
**Rationale:** Video_006 has phases 1-6 complete (full taxonomy extraction) but Phase 7 (Final Report) is pending. This distinction is important for accurate tracking.

### Decision 2: Video_007 Priority #1 in Queue
**Rationale:** Video_007 has partial work (6 workflows extracted) but high value content. Completing it provides more value than starting new videos from scratch.

### Decision 3: Updated Quality Standards to Include Format Requirement
**Rationale:** Video_006 was originally in JSON format (lost 60+ taxonomy elements). Adding "Format: Markdown (.md) only - NOT JSON" prevents future issues.

### Decision 4: Created Two Completion Categories
**Rationale:**
- "Complete (all 7 phases)" = Video fully processed with final report
- "Taxonomy complete (phases 1-6)" = All extraction done, just needs final report write-up
This provides more granular tracking.

---

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Format Enforcement is Critical
**Issue:** Video_006 was originally in JSON format
**Impact:** Lost 60+ taxonomy elements (14 workflows, 12+ tools, action verbs)
**Solution:** Strengthened format requirements in v3.1, moved to top with 🔴 visual emphasis
**Prevention:** Added format validation checklist as first check

### Lesson 2: Taxonomy Can Be Incomplete Even with Full Transcription
**Issue:** Video_007 has full transcription but only 6 workflows extracted (estimate 15-20 total)
**Impact:** Incomplete representation of video value
**Solution:** Mark as "Partial" in INDEX, prioritize for completion
**Prevention:** Better quality checks during initial taxonomy extraction

### Lesson 3: INDEX Updates Need to Be Routine
**Issue:** Videos 006-007 not added to INDEX when created
**Impact:** Lost visibility, unclear status
**Solution:** Make INDEX update part of standard workflow
**Prevention:** Add "Update INDEX" to every video processing todo list
