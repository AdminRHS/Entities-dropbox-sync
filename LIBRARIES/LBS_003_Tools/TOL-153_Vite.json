  "description": "Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that provides extremely fast development server startup and hot module replacement (HMR). Built on native ES modules, Vite offers instant server start regardless of app size and lightning-fast HMR that stays fast as the app grows. Used in AI-assisted design system workflows as the foundation for React component showcase applications, providing the local development server for previewing generated UI components.",
