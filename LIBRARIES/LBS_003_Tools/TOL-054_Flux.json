  "description": "Flux is a family of state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models developed by Black Forest Labs (founded by former Stability AI researchers). Flux models are known for exceptional prompt adherence, superior text rendering within images, photorealistic output quality, and anatomically accurate human generation. The Flux family includes multiple variants (Flux Pro, Flux Dev, Flux Schnell) with different speed/quality tradeoffs. Flux models are particularly strong at: complex scene composition with many elements, rendering readable text in images, following detailed multi-part prompts accurately, generating photorealistic humans without common AI artifacts, and creating high-quality logos and brand imagery. Flux is available through various platforms including OpenArt (as Flux Kontext variant), Replicate, and other AI image generation services. The model architecture is based on diffusion transformers and represents a significant advancement over earlier Stable Diffusion models.",
