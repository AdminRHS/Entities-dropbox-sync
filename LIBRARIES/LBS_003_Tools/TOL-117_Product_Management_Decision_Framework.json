    "short": "Methodology for making product decisions based on explicit, documented principles rather than intuition, enabling faster, more consistent, and defensible choices",
    "detailed": "Product Management Decision Framework is a structured approach to decision-making where teams define explicit principles (criteria) upfront, then evaluate options against these principles systematically. Instead of debating endlessly or relying on gut feel, PMs document decision criteria (e.g., 'prioritize features that reduce time-to-value', 'avoid lock-in', 'optimize for learning over perfection'), score options, and make defensible choices with clear rationale. This methodology is especially valuable for recurring decision types (feature prioritization, build vs. buy, roadmap sequencing) where establishing principles once enables faster, more consistent decisions over time. Advanced practitioners create 'decision templates' for common scenarios.",
