    "detailed": "arXiv is a free distribution service and open-access archive for scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. Founded in 1991, it has become the primary pre-print repository for AI/ML research, allowing researchers to share findings before formal peer review. Papers receive arXiv IDs (e.g., 2301.12345) and are searchable by category, author, title, and abstract.",
