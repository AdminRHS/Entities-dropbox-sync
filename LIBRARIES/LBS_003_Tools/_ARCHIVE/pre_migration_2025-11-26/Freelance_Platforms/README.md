## Remote Helpers Strategic Context

### Critical Decision: LG Department Evaluation

**Current Model:**
- 11 employees, $5,000/month cost
- Declining appointments despite automation

**Alternative Model (Freelance Platforms):**
- UpWork or CloudTask for lead research
- Estimated cost: $2,000-$3,500/month (variable)
- Potential savings: $1,500-$3,000/month ($18K-$36K annually)

**Recommendation:** Pilot test UpWork/CloudTask for 2-3 months before final decision

### Sales Department SMM Support

**Current Model:**
- Sales employee handles sales + SMM + admin (33% each)
- SMM quality potentially diluted

**Alternative Model:**
- Hire part-time SMM via MarketerHire ($6K-$8K/month)
- Sales employee reallocates 10-15 hours/week to sales activities
- ROI: If 1 additional client/month at $3-5K profit, breaks even or positive

**Recommendation:** Evaluate if sales growth justifies SMM specialist

### Design Department Overflow

**Current Model:**
- 9-person design team (largest department)
- Capacity issues during peak periods

**Alternative Model:**
- Use 99designs for overflow ($300-$2K/project as needed)
- Alternative to hiring additional full-time designer ($3-5K/month fixed)

**Recommendation:** Use 99designs for overflow instead of full-time hire (more flexible, cost-effective)
