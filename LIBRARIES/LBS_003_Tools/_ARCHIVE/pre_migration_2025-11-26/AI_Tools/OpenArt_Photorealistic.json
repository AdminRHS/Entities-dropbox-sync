  "description": "OpenArt Photorealistic is an AI image generation model accessible exclusively through the OpenArt platform, specifically optimized for generating photorealistic human portraits and character images. In the demonstrated use case (Video 012), OpenArt Photorealistic successfully generated a realistic portrait of a woman used as a character reference for Google Veo 3.1's multi-image video generation feature (Elements). The model excels at creating lifelike human subjects with natural facial features, realistic skin textures, proper lighting, and authentic expressions, making it ideal for creating character references for video production workflows, marketing campaigns with diverse representation, and social media content featuring realistic human subjects.",

The exact technical specifications (base model, training data, specific optimizations) are not publicly documented. It may be: (1) A proprietary OpenArt model, (2) A fine-tuned version of an existing photorealistic model (Stable Diffusion, Flux, etc.), or (3) A licensed model with OpenArt branding. The demonstrated capability (realistic woman portrait with natural features) suggests strong portrait generation capabilities optimized for photorealism. Further research into OpenArt's model catalog would provide clarity on model lineage and technical specifications. User feedback indicates high-quality output suitable for professional video production workflows."
