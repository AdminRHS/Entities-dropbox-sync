  "description": "Seedream 4.0 is an AI image generation model accessible through the OpenArt platform, particularly optimized for generating high-quality object images and environmental scenes. In the demonstrated use case (Video 012), Seedream 4.0 successfully generated a marble statue and a park environment scene, both used as reference images for Google Veo 3.1's multi-image video generation feature (Elements). The model appears to excel at creating detailed objects with realistic textures and natural environments with proper lighting, making it ideal for creating reference images for video production workflows, product visualization, and scene composition.",

The exact technical specifications, training differences, or optimizations compared to other image models are not publicly documented. It may be: (1) A proprietary OpenArt model, (2) A fine-tuned version of an existing open-source model, or (3) A licensed model with OpenArt branding. The demonstrated capability (realistic marble statue with weathering, natural park environment) suggests strong object and environment generation capabilities. Further research into OpenArt's model catalog and Seedream-specific features would provide clarity. Version history (previous Seedream versions 1.0-3.0) should be investigated to understand model evolution."
