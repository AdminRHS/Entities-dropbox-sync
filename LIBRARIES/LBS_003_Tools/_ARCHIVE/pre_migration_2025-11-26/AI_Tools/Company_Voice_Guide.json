    "detailed": "Company Voice Guide is both a specific Dropbox Dash feature and a general methodology for ensuring AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Dash) produce content that matches a company's brand identity. Users upload or create documentation specifying preferred terminology (e.g., 'customers' not 'users'), tone (formal vs. casual), writing style, formatting conventions, and examples of on-brand vs. off-brand content. When AI generates text, it references this guide to maintain consistency. In Dropbox Dash, this is a dedicated feature; in other tools, it's achieved via custom instructions or system prompts. This is critical for customer-facing content, marketing materials, and maintaining brand integrity at scale.",
