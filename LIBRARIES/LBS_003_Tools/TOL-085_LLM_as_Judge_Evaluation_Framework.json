    "short": "Methodology for using one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another LLM, enabling automated quality assessment at scale with human-level judgment",
    "detailed": "LLM-as-Judge is an evaluation methodology where a powerful language model (the 'judge') is used to assess the quality, accuracy, helpfulness, and safety of outputs from another language model (the 'subject'). Instead of manual human evaluation (slow, expensive) or simple metrics (shallow, unreliable), this approach uses carefully crafted prompts to instruct a judge LLM to score responses on multiple dimensions. Advanced implementations use multi-tier architectures: fast/cheap models for initial filtering, expensive models for borderline cases, and human review only for critical edge cases. This enables evaluation at production scale while maintaining quality.",
