  "description": "Kimi K2 Thinking is a frontier-level, open-source, open-weights AI model from Chinese AI company Moonshot Labs. It is a thinking model capable of long-chain reasoning (200-300 sequential tool calls) and autonomous tool use including web search, code execution, and web browsing. Outperforms GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 on several difficult benchmarks including Humanity's Last Exam and BrowseComp.",
