  "description": "Wan 2.2 is an open-source AI video generation model released under Apache 2.0 license. It supports text-to-video and image-to-video generation with advanced features including lighting control, camera angle adjustments, time-of-day variations, and saturation control. Available in three model types: 14B parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) for text-to-video, 14B MoE for image-to-video, and 5B parameter hybrid model supporting both modes.",
