  "description": "ComfyUI is a powerful and modular node-based GUI for running AI image and video generation models. It provides a visual workflow builder where users can connect different components (models, samplers, encoders) to create custom generation pipelines. Particularly popular for AI video generation workflows like Wan 2.2, it offers pre-built templates and extensive customization options.",
