  "description": "Mayple is an innovative AI-driven marketing talent platform operating more like a digital marketing agency than a traditional freelance marketplace. The platform features 600+ hand-vetted marketing experts matched via AI algorithm based on detailed client briefs. Vetting is performance-based: marketers must demonstrate ability to drive results through previous work benchmarked against industry standards. Each client receives a pre-selected team of experts with a dedicated account manager for quality control. Offers live campaign monitoring for paid ads and requires 3-month minimum commitment (trial period) for substantial, long-term marketing results. Transparent pricing but premium cost reflecting agency-like service.",
