  "description": "Nano Banana is an AI image generation and editing tool specialized in creating high-quality visuals with specific style applications. Accessible through multiple platforms including GLIF (via Nano Banana Ultimate agent), Gemini/AI Studio, and OpenArt. Particularly effective for YouTube thumbnail generation, marketing imagery, style transfer applications (e.g., Mr. Beast style optimization), and product image editing. On OpenArt, Nano Banana functions as an image editing model for modifying existing images via text prompts, especially useful for creating product video end frames by changing backgrounds, rotating products, and modifying environments while maintaining subject consistency.",
