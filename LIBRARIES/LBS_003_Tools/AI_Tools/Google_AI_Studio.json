  "description": "Google's official comprehensive AI workbench for experimenting with Gemini AI models. Features four core modules: Chat (structured AI conversations with system instructions), Stream (real-time voice/webcam/screen-sharing collaboration), Generate Media (Veo AI video generation from text/images), and Build (no-code web app generation with Cloud Run deployment). Provides browser-based interface for testing prompts, comparing model outputs, building AI applications, and accessing Gemini API. Includes advanced features like temperature control, thinking mode, code execution, function calling, Google Search grounding, and multimodal support (text, images, video, audio). Free tier with generous quotas for development and testing.",
