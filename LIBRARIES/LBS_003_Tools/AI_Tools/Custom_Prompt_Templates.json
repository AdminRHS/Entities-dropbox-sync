    "detailed": "Custom Prompt Templates is a productivity methodology where users create libraries of carefully crafted, tested prompts for recurring tasks with AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.). Instead of writing prompts from scratch each time, users maintain a personal or team collection of optimized templates with placeholders for variable inputs. Templates include context, desired format, tone, constraints, and examples. Advanced practitioners organize templates by category (writing, analysis, coding, etc.), version them, and share with teams. This approach transforms ad-hoc AI usage into systematic, repeatable workflows with consistent quality.",
