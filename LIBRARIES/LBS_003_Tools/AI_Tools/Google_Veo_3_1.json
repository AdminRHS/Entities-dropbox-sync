  "description": "Google Veo 3.1 is Google's latest AI video generation model that significantly outperforms previous versions and competitors like Sora 2. Key improvements include: (1) Start/End Frame Control - allowing precise control over how videos begin and end, enabling seamless multi-scene sequences of unlimited length; (2) Multi-Image Frames Feature - ability to generate videos using 1-3 reference images for characters, objects, and environments; (3) Significantly improved audio quality with more detailed and realistic environmental sounds; (4) Enhanced visual realism with better textures, lighting, and motion that eliminates the 'plastic AI look'; (5) Superior prompt adherence - follows instructions much more accurately; (6) Faster generation speed compared to competitors. Primarily accessed through the OpenArt platform.",
