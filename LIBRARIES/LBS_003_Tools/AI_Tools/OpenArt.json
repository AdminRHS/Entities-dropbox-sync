  "purpose": "Unified AI content creation platform providing access to multiple AI models for image, video, and audio generation in one interface",
  "description": "OpenArt is a comprehensive AI content creation platform that aggregates and provides access to the latest AI models across image generation, video generation, and audio synthesis. Instead of requiring users to switch between multiple separate AI services, OpenArt offers a unified interface where creators can generate images, create videos, and produce audio all in one place. The platform serves as an orchestration layer, providing early access to new AI models (like Google Veo 3.1) as soon as they're released. Key features include: automatic prompt saving across model switches, unified asset management (create images then immediately use in video generation), integrated workflow (Elements feature for multi-image video generation), and seamless transitions between different AI models without context switching. OpenArt is particularly valuable for video producers and content creators who need to coordinate multiple AI tools in their workflows.",
