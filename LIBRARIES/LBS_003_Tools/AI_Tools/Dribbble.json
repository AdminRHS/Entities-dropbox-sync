  "description": "Dribbble is a community platform where designers showcase their work, providing a rich source of design inspiration for UI/UX, branding, illustration, and more. The platform is particularly valuable for AI-assisted design workflows as a source of high-quality design system screenshots that can be analyzed and extracted by AI models like GPT-5. Users search for 'design system' keywords to find flat, clear UI component layouts that serve as inspiration sources for the 3-prompt design system generation methodology. Dribbble's focus on apps and user interfaces makes it ideal for finding comprehensive design system examples.",
