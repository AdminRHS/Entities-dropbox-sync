  "description": "Antigravity is a humorous Easter egg module included in Python's standard library since Python 3.0. When imported, it opens a web browser to display xkcd comic #353, which humorously depicts Python's ability to make programming feel effortless ('I learned 90% of everything in a couple of hours'). This module serves as a playful demonstration of Python's philosophy and community culture.",
