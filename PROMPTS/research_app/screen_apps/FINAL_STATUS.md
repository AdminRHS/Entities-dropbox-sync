## ⏳ Remaining Work

### 8 Screen Prompts Still Needed

**Easy (1 screen):**
- 02_search_queue_screen

**Medium (4 screens):**
- 01_video_queue_screen
- 03_filter_panel
- 05_upload_transcription_screen
- 08_progress_tracker_widget

**Complex (3 screens):**
- 06_entity_extraction_viewer
- 07_gap_analysis_screen
- 10_knowledge_map_viewer

## 🎯 Recommendation

### Option A: Use What You Have
- Build the 2 completed screens with Lovable
- Use them as templates to create the other 8 yourself
- You have the pattern now (Overview, Sample Data, Tech Stack, Component Code, etc.)

### Option B: Continue Creation
- I can create the remaining 8 prompts (~2-3 hours)
- Each will follow the same structure as the 2 completed ones
- All will include sample data for testing

### Option C: Selective Creation
- Tell me which 2-3 screens you need most urgently
- I'll create those specific prompts next
- Example: "Create video queue, filter panel, and upload screens"
