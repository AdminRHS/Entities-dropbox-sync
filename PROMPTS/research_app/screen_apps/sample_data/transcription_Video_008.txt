## Key Concepts

### What is an MCP?
- **MCP** = Model Context Protocol = Connector
- Allows AI to connect to external applications
- Can provide read, write, and send permissions
- Runs locally or in cloud

### Why Custom Connectors?
1. **Limited Pre-built Options** - Not all apps have existing connectors
2. **Read-Only Restrictions** - Many connectors only allow reading, not writing/acting
3. **Full Control** - Custom connectors give complete access permissions

### Skills Explained
- **Skills** = Subset of prompts + code packaged to achieve specific tasks
- Reusable across Claude sessions
- Enable complex automation workflows

## Setup Process

### General Steps for Any Connector
1. **Save Files**: Create folder named after app (Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
2. **Get Credentials**: Obtain API keys from application
3. **Configure Claude Desktop**: Add connector to settings
4. **Verify**: Check connector shows as "configured" in Claude settings

### Using AI Assistance for Setup

## Best Practices

### Security Warnings
⚠️ **"With great power comes great responsibility"**
- Don't connect to production databases
- Don't connect to critical client data
- Ensure backups before giving AI write access
- Start with test/sandbox environments

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Local**: Run connectors locally first
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality before production use
3. **Stack Connectors in Projects**: Use Claude Projects for complex workflows
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Once confident, deploy to cloud for mobile access

### Model Selection
- **GPT-5**: Good for visual/UI tasks
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Best for code generation and tool calling
- **Use Sonnet 4.5** for creating connectors

## Pro Tips

1. **Use Claude Desktop**: Required for local connector execution
2. **Verify Connectors**: Check settings → connectors → look for "configured" status
3. **Explicit Prompts**: Tell Claude which connector to use if not auto-detected
4. **Projects for Automation**: Create dedicated Claude projects for recurring workflows
5. **Stack Multiple Connectors**: Combine 3+ connectors for powerful automation
