## Workflows Mentioned

### WORKFLOW: Agentic RAG with Dual Search
**OBJECTIVE**: Intelligently choose between vector database and knowledge graph based on query type

**COMPONENTS**:
- AI agent as decision maker
- Vector database (PGVector) for semantic search
- Knowledge graph (Neo4j + Graphiti) for entity/relationship queries
- LangGraph for routing logic

**USE CASE**: Different query types require different retrieval strategies

### WORKFLOW: Multi-Agent SEO Research System
**OBJECTIVE**: Parallel research across SEO, social media, and competitor analysis

**STEPS**:
1. User submits research request via chat interface
2. LangGraph orchestrates 3 specialized agents in parallel:
   - SEO Research Agent
   - Social Media Research Agent
   - Competitor Research Agent
3. Each agent works independently in isolated context windows
4. Results aggregated and presented in unified dashboard

**TOOLS USED**: Pydantic AI (agents), LangGraph (orchestration), Fast API (backend), Postgres (storage)
