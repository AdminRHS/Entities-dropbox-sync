**STEPS**:
1. Upload multiple candidate CVs as PDF files into NotebookLM
2. Upload the Job Description (JD) document
3. Prompt: "Use JD and benchmark and screen attached CVs against the JD. Give me top five candidates suitable for the role. Please give me a score for each candidate along with strengths and weaknesses."
4. NotebookLM extracts data from PDFs and stores in database
5. AI analyzes each CV against JD requirements
6. Generates ranked list of top 5 candidates
7. Provides suitability score (0-100) for each candidate
8. Lists strengths and weaknesses for each candidate
9. Review analysis to identify best-fit candidates

**DURATION**: A few minutes
**COMPLEXITY**: Low
**TOOLS USED**: NotebookLM, Gemini 2.0, PDF files
**INPUT**: Folder with multiple CVs (PDFs) + Job Description document
**OUTPUT**: Ranked top 5 candidates with scores (e.g., 88/100, 85/100, 82/100, 80/100, 78/100), strengths, and weaknesses

### WORKFLOW 2: HR Interview Question Generation
**OBJECTIVE**: Automatically generate relevant HR interview questions for shortlisted candidates

**STEPS**:
1. Use existing context of uploaded CVs and JD
2. Prompt: "Based on the JD, can you please prepare HR interview questions for the shortlisted candidates?"
3. AI generates two types of questions:
   - **General HR questions** (applicable to all candidates)
   - **Candidate-specific questions** (based on individual CV details)
4. Review generated questions

**DURATION**: Under 1 minute
**COMPLEXITY**: Low
**INPUT**: Context from previous screening workflow
**OUTPUT**:
- General questions: "Where do you see yourself professionally in next 3-5 years?", "What is your motivation?", "Tell us about your career trajectory"
- Specific questions: Tailored to each candidate's experience and background

### WORKFLOW 3: Technical Interview Preparation
**OBJECTIVE**: Generate technical interview questions focused on specific technologies (e.g., Azure cloud stack)

**STEPS**:
1. Build on existing context
2. Prompt: "Can you now prepare questions for technical interview for all these candidates? Keep a focus on Azure cloud stack."
3. AI generates:
   - General technical questions for all candidates
   - Candidate-specific technical questions based on CV experience
4. Review questions

**DURATION**: Under 1 minute
**COMPLEXITY**: Medium
**INPUT**: Context + technology focus (Azure)
**OUTPUT**:
- General: "Can you describe your experience with Azure cloud services relevant to data analytics?"
- Specific: "You mentioned experience with Azure, can you describe a specific Azure project where you were involved in data analysis and building data models?"

### WORKFLOW 4: Final Round Consulting Interview
**OBJECTIVE**: Prepare final interview questions with focus on consulting skills

**STEPS**:
1. Continue with existing context
2. Prompt: "Can you please prepare questions for final interview and keep focus on consulting skills?"
3. AI generates consulting-focused questions for each candidate
4. Review and customize as needed

**DURATION**: Under 1 minute
