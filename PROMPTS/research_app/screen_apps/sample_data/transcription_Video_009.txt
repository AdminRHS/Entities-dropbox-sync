## Three-Prompt Framework

### PROMPT 1: Extract High-Level Design Style
**Objective**: Analyze screenshot and create initial design.json with high-level guidelines

**Prompt**:
```
Deeply analyze the design of the attached screenshot to create a design.json file in this project that describes the style and design of every component needed in a design system at a high level like a creative director.

Capture high level guidelines for structure, spacing, fonts, colors, design style and design principles so I can use this file as the design guidelines for my app.

The goal with this file is to instruct AI to be able to replicate this look easily in a project.
```

**Model**: GPT-5 (better at visual/UI analysis)
**Output**: design.json file with brand essence, tone, colors, typography

### PROMPT 2: Build Showcase App
**Objective**: Create visual representation of all components

**Prompt**:
```
Let's create a simple screen that contains every UI component that would exist in a design system on a mock dashboard following the design style outlined in design.json.

Build this as a Vite app using React and translate all styling into Tailwind version 3. Just run this locally.
```

**Model**: Sonnet 4.5 (better for coding tasks)
**Output**: Complete Vite app with all UI components rendered

### PROMPT 3: Create Comprehensive Design System
**Objective**: Generate detailed design-system.json from built components

**Prompt**:
```
In this project, create a folder named 'design' and create a design-system.json file in this folder that outlines the exact styling for all components and styles in this app, along with a high-level design guidelines.

The goal with this file is to create a comprehensive guide for AI to follow when building new features in this app.
```

**Model**: GPT-5 (better for UI documentation)
**Output**: design-system.json with 646 lines of detailed component specs

## Workflow: AI-Assisted Design System Generation

**DEPARTMENT**: Design / Development
**OBJECTIVE**: Extract design style from visual inspiration and generate comprehensive, reusable design system framework

**STEPS**:
1. Search Dribbble for "design system" inspiration
2. Select flat, clear screenshot with UI components
3. Paste screenshot into Cursor Agent mode
4. Execute Prompt 1 (GPT-5) → creates design.json
5. Execute Prompt 2 (Sonnet 4.5) → builds showcase app
6. Review components in Cursor browser tab
7. Make any design tweaks (optional)
8. Execute Prompt 3 (GPT-5) → creates comprehensive design-system.json
9. Use design-system.json in future projects

**DURATION**: 15-20 minutes total
**COMPLEXITY**: Medium
**TOOLS USED**: Dribbble, Cursor, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Vite, React, Tailwind CSS

**INPUT**: Screenshot of design system from Dribbble
**OUTPUT**:
- design.json (high-level guide)
- Complete showcase app (Vite + React)
- design-system.json (646-line comprehensive spec)

## Design.json Structure (Output of Prompt 1)

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "essence": "optimistic, clear, helpful",
    "tone_of_voice": "friendly, professional",
    "keywords": ["clean", "approachable"]
  },
  "style": {
    "design_language": "soft round white surfaces floating on citrus canvas with subtle shadows",
    "primary_accent": "vivid purple",
    "positive_action": "lime green"
  },
  "principles": [
    "softness over sharpness",
    "generous border radius and pill shapes",
    "airy spacing",
    "hierarchy",
    "low contrast",
    "human first visuals",
    "clarity and restraint"
  ],
  "border_radius": "...",
  "breakpoints": "...",
  "colors": "...",
  "typography": "..."
}
```

## Best Practices

### Finding Inspiration on Dribbble
✅ **Good Screenshot Qualities**:
- Flat layout with clear components
- Multiple UI elements visible
- No excessive annotations or borders
- Clean, single-purpose showcase
- High clarity/resolution

❌ **Avoid**:
- Poster-style layouts
- Too-small components
- Heavy annotations (purple dashed borders, etc.)
- Complex backgrounds
- Multi-page screenshots

### Model Selection
- **GPT-5**: Visual tasks, UI analysis, design documentation
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Code generation, component building
- **Composer**: Quick fixes, small tweaks (not for initial design system)

### Resolution Considerations
- **480p**: Fast generation but pixelated faces/details
- **720p**: Recommended for production work (736 x 1,280 in Cursor)
- Use higher resolution for character-focused or detailed work

### Using the Design System

**In Cursor**:
- Reference `@design-system.json` in prompts
- Keep design system file in project
- Update file as you make design tweaks

**In Lovable/Bolt**:
- Copy entire design-system.json into first prompt, OR
- Add to Knowledge section in settings, OR
- Use refactor prompt: "Refactor the entire UI of my app. Do not change anything functional but follow these exact design guidelines: [paste design-system.json]"

## Advanced Tips

### Cursor Browser Tab
- Click web icon in chat
- Open browser tab to view localhost
- No need to leave Cursor
- Select elements for targeted tweaks

### Agent Mode in Cursor
- Use "New Agent" for new tasks
- Clear chat context between different features
- Keeps AI focused on current task

### Incremental Refinement
After Prompt 2:
- Make design tweaks before Prompt 3
- Ensure all components are exactly as desired
- Update spacing, colors, typography
- Then run Prompt 3 to lock in final system

## Comparison to Manual Screenshot Copying

### Traditional Approach:
- Drop screenshot → "Copy this design"
- AI generalizes and fills gaps
- Defaults to basic styling
- Inconsistent results

### Three-Prompt Framework:
- High-level style extraction first
- Build all components visually
- Comprehensive documentation
- Step-by-step guidance for AI
- Reusable across projects

## Use Cases

1. **Starting New Projects**: Begin with design system, then build features
2. **Redesigning Existing Apps**: Refactor UI without breaking functionality
3. **Team Collaboration**: Share design-system.json for consistency
4. **Multi-Platform Apps**: Reuse system across web, mobile
5. **Client Work**: Fast design system setup from client inspiration

## Notes

Excellent systematic approach to design system generation with AI. Three-prompt framework separates concerns: 1) High-level extraction, 2) Visual component building, 3) Comprehensive documentation. GPT-5 for visual analysis, Sonnet 4.5 for code. Output is production-ready design-system.json (646 lines) usable in Cursor, Lovable, or Bolt. Avoids common pitfall of screenshot-only copying where AI fills gaps poorly. Dribbble as primary inspiration source. Vite + React + Tailwind ensures compatibility with modern AI coding tools. Design system is reusable, editable, and AI-friendly structured data (JSON). Time investment: 15-20 minutes for complete system. Ideal for starting projects with strong visual foundation.
