# Video Naming: Straight-to-Business Alternatives Prompt
## Creating Professional, Taxonomy-Friendly Video Titles for Library Checklist-Item-003s

**Purpose**: Transform casual, clickbait, or promotional video titles into clear, professional, business-focused alternatives suitable for taxonomy documentation and library listings.

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Status**: Active - Production Ready

---

## Overview

YouTube and social media videos often use:
- **Clickbait titles**: "This Changes Everything!", "You Won't Believe What Happened!"
- **Promotional language**: "MUST SEE!", "GAME CHANGER!", excessive emojis
- **Casual phrasing**: "How I...", "My secret to...", "Check this out!"
- **Vague descriptions**: "Amazing AI Tool", "Cool New Feature"

For taxonomy documentation and professional library listings, we need:
- **Clear, descriptive titles** that explain what the video actually covers
- **Professional language** without hype or clickbait
- **Taxonomy-relevant keywords** (tools, workflows, processes)
- **Searchable, categorizable** naming conventions

---

## Naming Principles

### 1. Be Descriptive and Specific

**Bad**: "This AI Tool is Insane!"
**Good**: "GLIF AI Workflow Automation Platform Tutorial"

**Bad**: "How I 10x My Productivity"
**Good**: "Automating Content Creation with AI Agents (GLIF Tutorial)"

### 2. Lead with Key Technology/Tool

**Bad**: "You Need to Try This for Thumbnails"
**Good**: "Nano Banana: AI YouTube Thumbnail Generation Tutorial"

**Bad**: "The Best Way to Make Videos Now"
**Good**: "VAYU + Seedream: Miniature Documentary Video Creation Workflow"

### 3. Include Workflow/Process Type

**Bad**: "Amazing Video Creation"
**Good**: "Automated Documentary Creation Workflow (GLIF + VAYU + Eleven Labs)"

**Bad**: "Make Better Thumbnails"
**Good**: "High-CTR YouTube Thumbnail Creation Process (AI-Assisted)"

### 4. Remove AI Language

**Bad**: "Revolutionary RAG System You MUST Know!"
**Good**: "Google Gemini File Search: Managed RAG Solution Overview"

**Bad**: "This DESTROYS Traditional Video Editing!"
**Good**: "AI Video Generation vs Traditional Editing: Workflow Comparison"

### 5. Use Professional Terminology

**Bad**: "Crazy Cool AI Stuff"
**Good**: "AI Workflow Automation Tools and Techniques"

**Bad**: "How to Get Insane Results"
**Good**: "Optimizing AI Video Generation Output Quality"

## Conversion Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Content

Read video transcription and identify:
1. **Primary tool(s)** discussed
2. **Main workflow(s)** demonstrated
3. **Target use case(s)**
4. **Key technologies/concepts**

### Step 2: Extract Technical Terms

Replace casual language with professional terms:

| Casual | Professional |
|--------|-------------|
| "10x your game" | "Productivity optimization" or "Workflow efficiency" |
| "insane results" | "High-quality output" or "Optimal performance" |
| "game changer" | "Significant advancement" or "Innovative approach" |
| "must see" | "Important overview" or "Essential guide" |
| "amazing tool" | "[Tool name]: [Function]" |
| "cool feature" | "[Feature name]: [Capability]" |
| "my secret" | "Workflow technique" or "Process optimization" |

### Step 3: Structure Title

Choose appropriate template based on video content:

**Tutorial videos** → Template 1 or 4
**Workflow demonstrations** → Template 2 or 4
**Tool overviews** → Template 1 or 5
**Concept explanations** → Template 3 or 5

### Step 4: Validate Title

Check against criteria:
- [ ] Is it clear what the video covers?
- [ ] Are key tools/technologies mentioned?
- [ ] Is the language professional (no hype)?
- [ ] Is it searchable with relevant keywords?
- [ ] Is it suitable for a library catalog?
- [ ] Does it avoid clickbait/marketing language?
