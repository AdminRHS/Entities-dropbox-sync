# Mascot Story Scenarios Guide - Company Weekly Overview Integration

**Purpose:** Create clear, narrative-driven story scenarios for mascot visual environments that reflect Remote Helpers' weekly activities and strategic initiatives  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** December 25, 2025  
**Department:** Design / Creative  
**Use Case:** Game Academy course covers, weekly report visualizations, company announcements

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to creating **story scenarios** - complete narrative descriptions that transform company weekly themes into visual mascot stories set in natural environments. Each scenario tells a story that metaphorically represents company activities while maintaining authentic mascot natural habitat settings.

---

## What is a Story Scenario?

A **Story Scenario** is a complete narrative description that:
1. **Establishes Context:** Sets the scene in mascot's natural environment
2. **Introduces Character:** Features the mascot with personality and purpose
3. **Presents Challenge/Activity:** Shows mascot engaged in meaningful activity
4. **Reflects Company Theme:** Metaphorically represents company weekly theme
5. **Shows Outcome/Progress:** Demonstrates achievement or transformation

**Key Difference from Basic Prompt:**
- **Basic Prompt:** Lists elements (mascot, activity, location, accent)
- **Story Scenario:** Tells a complete story with narrative flow, context, and meaning

## Complete Story Scenarios by Weekly Theme

### Scenario 1: Framework Implementation & Architecture

#### Story Narrative
**"The Architect's Nest"**

Falcon the Falcon has spent weeks observing the chaotic, scattered nests of other birds. Today, they're building something different - a structured, organized nest using a systematic approach. They've gathered materials from three distinct sources (representing the 3-tier system: Company, Department, Employee), arranging them in hierarchical layers. Each branch is carefully placed according to a blueprint they've memorized. The nest grows stronger and more organized with each addition, creating a foundation that can support future growth.

**Visual Story Elements:**
- Falcon wearing a small architect's cap (blue, with measurement markings)
- Three distinct material piles (different sizes/types representing tiers)
- Organized branch structure showing hierarchy
- Blueprint-like patterns visible in nest construction
- Other birds' chaotic nests visible in background (contrast)

**Company Theme Connection:**
- 3-tier file system architecture (Company → Department → Employee)
- Systematic organization replacing chaos
- Foundation building for future growth
- Hierarchical structure implementation

**Complete Prompt:**
