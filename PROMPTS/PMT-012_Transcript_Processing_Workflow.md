## Introduction & Overview

### What This Process Does

This unified workflow transforms strategic priorities into actionable knowledge by:
1. **Finding** relevant videos based on actual work tasks and strategic initiatives
2. **Processing** video content through AI transcription and structured extraction
3. **Populating** libraries with validated tools, workflows, tasks, and skills

### Why This Matters for All Teams

**For Research Team:**
- Systematic video discovery based on strategic priorities
- Relevance scoring system (0-100) ensures quality
- Weekly research workflow keeps content fresh

**For AI Team:**
- Direct extraction of tools, workflows, and integration patterns
- 90-95% reduction in post-processing time (v3.2 improvements)
- Structured taxonomy-ready outputs

**For Video Team:**
- Understanding of video content processing pipeline
- Access to transcription and analysis tools
- Quality metrics for content evaluation

**For Content Team:**
- Curated, validated information from video sources
- Access to structured knowledge base
- Always-updated library of tools and workflows

### Time Investment & ROI

**Total Time Investment:**
- Stage 1 (Research): 2-3 hours/week
- Stage 2 (Processing): 40-80 minutes per video
- Stage 3 (Library Population): 10-20 minutes per video

**Return on Investment:**
- **Before v3.2**: 4.5-9.5 hours per video
- **After v3.2**: 50-100 minutes per video
- **Time Savings**: 90-95% reduction in processing time

1. Read this document fully
2. Review the 3 key prompts (Research, Transcription v3.2, Library Processing)
3. Shadow an experienced team member through one complete cycle
4. Process your first video with guidance
5. Complete 2-3 videos independently before full autonomy

**For Experienced Team Members:**
1. Review v3.2 enhancements (task/step/Project Templates)
2. Update your workflow to include new sections (4B, 4C, 4D, 7B, 13, 14)
3. Focus on task-step-skill linkage
4. Track your time savings vs pre-v3.2

**For Team Leads:**
1. Assign weekly research responsibility
2. Review gap analysis reports weekly

## Quick Start Checklist

**First Time Using This Workflow:**
- [ ] Read complete document (estimated 45-60 minutes)
- [ ] Review 3 key prompt documents (Research, Transcription v3.2, Library Processing)
- [ ] Set up tools (Perplexity, Google AI Studio, text editor)
- [ ] Familiarize with directory structure
- [ ] Shadow experienced team member (1 video cycle)

**Starting a New Week:**
- [ ] Review strategic priorities
- [ ] Monday: Run research (Stage 1)
- [ ] Tuesday: Select top videos
- [ ] Wed-Thu: Process videos (Stage 2)
- [ ] Friday: Populate libraries (Stage 3)

**Processing a Single Video:**
- [ ] Transcribe with v3.2 instructions (40-60 min)
- [ ] Extract all 14 taxonomy sections
- [ ] Validate quality (format, content, completeness)
- [ ] Integrate into libraries (10-20 min)
- [ ] Generate gap analysis

**You're Ready When:**
- [ ] You can score videos using the 0-100 system
- [ ] You can apply v3.2 custom instructions to extract taxonomy
- [ ] You understand task/step/skill naming conventions
- [ ] You can create tool JSON files with proper IDs
- [ ] You can generate gap analysis reports

**Remember**: This workflow saves 90-95% time vs manual processing. Follow the structure, use the naming conventions, and link all elements together. The more videos you process, the richer your libraries become!
