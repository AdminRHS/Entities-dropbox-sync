   - Type a test prompt or question
   - Verify you receive a response from Gemini
   - Test code assistance features if available

9. **Understand key features**
   - **Chat Interface:** Access Gemini chat directly in VS Code
   - **Code Assistance:** Get AI help with coding tasks
   - **Document Analysis:** Analyze and summarize documents
   - **Gemini 3 Pro:** Access to advanced model with more tokens
   - **Context Awareness:** Works with your open files and workspace

10. **Set up workspace integration**
    - Open your Dropbox work folder in VS Code
    - Verify AntiGravity can access your workspace files
    - Test asking questions about files in your workspace
    - Understand how to reference files in conversations

11. **Configure resource management**
    - Be aware that AntiGravity uses computer resources
    - Monitor system performance when using extension
    - Close other resource-intensive applications if needed
    - AntiGravity works alongside Cursor and other AI tools

12. **Learn keyboard shortcuts**
    - Identify shortcut to open AntiGravity chat (if available)
    - Learn how to quickly access Gemini features
    - Customize shortcuts in VS Code settings if needed

13. **Verify integration with workflow**
    - Test using AntiGravity for document analysis
    - Test code generation and assistance
    - Verify it works alongside other tools (Cursor, Perplexity, etc.)
    - Understand when to use AntiGravity vs other AI tools

## Requirements

- Accounts needed:
  - Google account (work/corporate email recommended)
  - VS Code account (if using sync features)
- Tools needed:
  - VS Code installed and configured (TASK-002)
  - Internet connection (for AI features)
  - Computer with sufficient resources
- Prerequisites:
  - TASK-002: Setup VS Code (must be completed first)
  - Work Google account access
  - Understanding of VS Code basics
