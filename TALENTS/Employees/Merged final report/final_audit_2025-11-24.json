Перше, так, дійсно здається зайвим оцей sidebar, але фішка в тому, що в чому складність, чому б його не дуже прибирати. В нас така логіка, що всі наші проекти мають мати однаковий layout, просто банально, щоб нам було зручніше і простіше. На наших проєктах орієнтуватися, тобто, якщо в нас усюди зараз я повідкриваю різні паралельно академію ту саму, усюди в нас внизу є можливість профіль, логаут, там якась навігація, то відповідно і в академії хочеться, щоб той самий профіль та кнопочка логаута була все ж таки внизу. В одному стилі. Що я зараз бачу? По-перше, я зараз бачу те, що в нас немає нашої аватарки. Вона натягнеться, або давай я зараз спробую через Google зайти, можливо, зараз підтягнеться краще. А підтягується, так, вона в нас тут така квадратненька. Давай зробимо, по-перше, її круглою на сто відсотків, і по-друге, зазвичай. Хлопаєш? Добре. У нас є, якщо в нас, наприклад, немає аватарки для адміна, в нас просто перша літера, відповідно, username. Давай, да. Перша літера в upper case. Нам цього вистачить і круглий аватар. Я записую це у Visper Pro. Тобто зараз ти зможеш витягнути з мого файлу за сьогоднішнє число, знайти тут, так, розбір фронталу, медіа-бібліотеки, і там вже розпишеш собі, що про фронту підправити. Зараз займемось більше таким. Не впевнена, що воно взагалі має бути дашборд, такий якесь дашборд/медіа. У нас по факту одна сторінка медіабібліотеки. Я взагалі б от… Так… Та-та, то я взагалі б прибрала… Можливо, я б лишила просто на сторінці медіа отут. Тобто прибрала б дашборди, просто тут медіа або пусте місце. Бо якщо ми заходимо кудись в середину, якщо в нас є вкладеність певна, то все ж таки хочеться, щоб тут був якийсь предкрамп для вкладеності. Не впевнена, що нам треба оці 2 кнопки Back і Root, тому що у нас по факту є предкрамп, нам його вистачає. А у нас усюди схожа логіка, тобто, якщо ми на академію підемо кудись в середину курсів, будь-яких курсів зараз, тобто, у нас є логіка, так, у нас немає тут і ніякої кнопки back. У нас тут, ну, редагування, відповідно, так, і якщо ми йдемо далі в урок, тобто в нас вже вкладеність. Тобто у нас є курси, курс, урок, тобто в нас знову ж таки в нас усюди буде схожа логіка. Плюс в майбутньому в нас буде одна медіабібліотека, тобто, от, наприклад, якщо ти там, може, дивився Муї Бульма і тому подібні штуки. В нас є якісь компоненти. У бібліотеці у нас вже вони певним чином застилізовані. Ми будемо робити свою власну бібліотеку зі своїми стилями, підключати її всередину проєкта, і відповідно там ми можемо щось міняти: якісь заокруглення, якісь там, не знаю, кольори. Але, по факту, воно в нас в проєктах буде однакове, тобто виглядати воно в нас буде однаково, і нам буде простіше, банально, працювати, навігуватись. Тому і кнопки у нас там плюс-мінус будуть однакові. Єдине, ми можемо там бавитись знову ж таки зі стилями, але, ну, логічніше, екологіка в нас буде знову ж таки однакова, там, які стани, так, наші такі глобальні, там, при наведенні, дизайн, були, тому подібні. Тобто, зараз щодо стилів я б так не виділяла якось прям окремо, тобто це буде в майбутньому просто підключатись глобально, так, і використовувати звіти. Тобто щодо стилів дуже зараз просто, щоб воно в одному стилі зараз було, та, а там вже далі будемо оновлювати. Ааа, тобто, як на мене, оці кнопки зайві, тому що нам вистачає продкрампа на сторінці тоді медія нашій головній. Не знаю, наскільки нам потрібний цей роут, якщо чесно, можемо просто послашу його, так, у Media Library, це в нас основна сторінка. Так далі в мене дивись, я бачу, що тут, скоріше за все, грінд да сіточка. Мені, якщо чесно, не дуже подобається, що нам треба точно тут буде підправити. Давай, тут зараз міняється ширина, але не міняється ніяк висота, і через це у нас немає аспект рейтінг ніякого. Тобто масштабування тут не дуже гарно виглядає. Я б встановила або як для блока, або як тут зображення чи цей. Встановлююся зазвичай аспект рейтінгу, у нас здається 18 на 9, можу помилятися. Або 9 на 18. І тоді в нас прям воно, да, я десь помилилася, 1.77, здається, отак от воно взагалі встановлюється. Воно зараз у мене так не працює, треба буде глянути, що там саме треба буде для цього. Ага, це все кнопка, глянь, щоб в нас просто воно не звужилось так, бо воно не дуже добре виглядає. Тобто отак от встановлюєш відповідно для відоса, у нас там буде воно, і для картинки там певним чином або кавером, або контейнер відповідно. Там же треба буде побавитись, подивитись. Те саме для зображення, бо різні ширини екрану бувають, воно не гарно виглядає. Тобто попрацювати з карточками. Спробуй позавантажувати різні формати, да? Як воно буде відображатись. Так само спробуй ще, знаєш що? Для відосів спробуй завантажити вертикальний відос, як для шорти. Те ж, як воно буде. Тобто воно має бути відповідно, як отут картинка по центру і там якимось фоном залитися. Тобто, по факту, тобі оцю частину, де в нас така типу прев'юшка, от вона в нас має бути просто масштабована з певними пропорціями, а там вже всередині відповідно воно буде поміщатися. Можливо, навіть вище зроби, не там стандартний для відоса, а зроби трошки вище. Буде десь там вільне місце з чимось якимось кольором, заповнюватись. Можливо, так навіть буде краще виглядати. Треба подивитись, подумати, попитати. Тобто картки будуть однакові, і просто прев'юшка буде відповідно від типу файлу відображатись по-іншому. Глянути ще трошки треба буде по оцих модалках. Особливо поділити увагу на Add New Assets. З чим може бути проблема? Було б, може, бути, наприклад, якщо ми з мобілки перевертаємо на альбомну розкладку і відкриваємо, то в нас немає нижньої частини, де наші мають бути кнопочки: канцела, сетс і так далі. Яка в нас взагалі стандартна логіка, структура оцих модалок? В нас обов'язково має бути якийсь хедер модалки, контент, серединка вся і футер. Хедер і футер в нас зазвичай зафіксовані, тобто в нас є взагалі якийсь розмір всієї модалки. При цьому хедер у нас зафіксований, футер фіксований. А сам контент, якщо у нас по висоті, наприклад, не вміщається, має бути зі скроллом. Зараз він просто виштовхує наш футер, тобто навіть якщо ми зараз на розмірку отак от подивимося, дійсно хедер відділяється в нас, а от контент і футер — ні. Тобто футер має в нас в таких моментах, як хедер, фіксуватися, а внутрішній контент скролитись, тобто має бути скролл-барчик, що з'являється, і ми відповідно можемо його скролити. Всіляке може статись, і, наприклад, буде не банально, ми не можемо навіть проскролити до кнопок, щоб підтвердити, бо в мене така ситуація вийшла в кросори: я там відкрила термінал, те відкрила, це відкрила, і в мене виходить так, що я банально зараз не можу зручно працювати, бо коли я вже завантажую якийсь файлик, воно просто у мене з'їжджає вниз в якийсь момент, і я навіть, ну, не знаю, що там навіть має бути кнопка — це незручно. Можливо, навіть простіше зробити цю логіку модалок, оскільки в нас тут тавін. Зробити якийсь окремий компонент, я просто не пам'ятаю, як тут зроблено. Ну так, тут діалоги є. Глянути, перевірити, щоб була ця логіка розбиття. В нас хедер, футер модалки і контент відповідний. Це з такого. Можна ще насправді примикач тем додати? Бо я дивлюся, якось воно зараз насправді дивно виглядає. Де я конфіг глянула. Да, в нас є dark mode, але по факту в нас він візуально ніде не має примикача. Да. Да, да. З того, що треба буде додати, дивись, обов'язково mode. Тобто в нас він усюди над профілем. Спробую трошки оновити sidebar, поки ми його лишаємо точно. Ми додаємо light mode, dark mode, відповідно. Далі в нас буде профіль, під ним давай кнопку логаута. Так буде правильніше, бо в нас воно так усюди налаштоване. Тобто не треба при кліку відображати логаут. Він одразу має бути під профілем відповідно. Я тобі зараз пошукаю файл щодо sidebar-а, щодо цієї кнопочки, щоб зробити в одному стилі. Бачиш, тут у нас в такому стилі, тут у нас в такому стилі. Зараз ще один покажу тобі варіант. В такому самому стилі. Тобто в нас усюди різні, в принципі, бібліотеки, але воно однаково візуально і зрозуміло відображається. Тобто це треба буде перевірити щодо sidebar-у. Я зараз пошукаю файл. ```**Outcomes:**-### [13:15 - 17:15] - [Working on tasks in upload_crm]**Completed Tasks:**1. &nbsp;**Sidebar** ✅&nbsp; &nbsp; - Maintained global layout: profile at the bottom, logout button immediately below it, theme switcher (light/dark) above the profile.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ensured avatar is always round; displays the first letter of the name if no photo is available.2. &nbsp;**Navigation** ✅&nbsp; &nbsp; - Removed the redundant Dashboard route and Back/Root buttons to ensure the main route opens the Media Library directly.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Implemented breadcrumbs as the sole navigation method between nested folders.3. &nbsp;**Media Cards** ✅&nbsp; &nbsp; - Aligned previews: fixed aspect ratio (≈16:9) with adaptive cropping for images and videos.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Verified display of portrait and landscape files to ensure centering with background fill.4. &nbsp;**Modals** ✅&nbsp; &nbsp; - Refactored structure: fixed header and footer, scrollable middle content. Action buttons are always visible, even on mobile landscape.5. &nbsp;**Theme Switcher** ✅&nbsp; &nbsp; - Added a prominent light/dark theme toggle in the sidebar (above the profile) and connected it to the current theme logic.**What I worked on:**- **Sidebar Enhancements:**&nbsp; - Implemented smooth CSS transitions for the sidebar collapse/expand action, replacing abrupt conditional rendering.&nbsp; - Aligned the \"Collapse\" button with the \"Media Library\" menu item.&nbsp; - Standardized icon sizes (Profile, Theme Toggle, Logout) to be consistent in the collapsed state.- **Media Card Improvements:**&nbsp; - Standardized media previews to a fixed 16:9 aspect ratio (`aspect-video`).&nbsp; - Implemented adaptive cropping and centering for both portrait and landscape images/videos.&nbsp; - Added a blurred background effect for media previews to replace plain black backgrounds.&nbsp; - Introduced hover animations: cards lift up, and media zooms in (parallax effect) for a more dynamic feel.- **Modal Refactoring:**&nbsp; - Restructured all modals (`CreateFolderModal`, `EditFolderModal`, `EditAssetModal`, `UploadModal`, `ConfirmationDialog`) to have a fixed header and footer with a scrollable content area.&nbsp; - Optimized layout for mobile landscape view (`max-h-[90vh]`), ensuring action buttons are always visible.&nbsp; - Fixed a specific layout issue in `UploadModal` where the footer was hidden, ensuring it remains fixed at the bottom.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**Refactored Sidebar.jsx to use single render structure with CSS transitions for smooth collapsing. Aligned collapse button with Media Library icon. Resized profile icon in collapsed state. Updated AssetItem.jsx to use fixed 16:9 aspect ratio for previews. Implemented blurred background effect for images and videos using dual-layer approach. Added hover animations for cards (lift up) and media (zoom in). Refactored CreateFolderModal.jsx, EditFolderModal.jsx, EditAssetModal.jsx, UploadModal.jsx, and ConfirmationDialog.jsx to implement fixed header/footer and scrollable content pattern. Fixed UploadModal layout to ensure footer visibility.**Outcomes:**- **Smoother Sidebar:** The sidebar now collapses and expands fluidly with all elements transitioning correctly.- **Polished Media Grid:** Media items look uniform and professional with the new aspect ratio and blurred backgrounds. The UI feels more \"alive\" due to hover effects.- **Responsive Modals:** All modals are now fully usable on smaller screens and landscape orientations, with critical action buttons always accessible.- **Code Quality:** Removed duplicate code and fixed linting errors in `Sidebar.jsx`.---## Notes-## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcripts","Discord ID":"1437335424367460363","Employee ID":"88853"},{"Date":"2025-11-24","Verdict":"📦 PROJECT","Issue":"External Project","Employee Name":"Olga S","Department":"Designers","Profession":"UI UX designer","Current Status":"Project","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Discord Time":"8.37","CRM Time":"8.32","Discord Minutes":502,"CRM Status":"Active","First Check-in":"2025-11-24 06:58:18","Last Check-out":"2025-11-24 16:17:23","Report":"Date: November  24, 2025\nDepartment: Design\nProject Name: Store Module\nTask Name: Store Module Finalization &amp; NFC\nTask Status: CompletedDescription of Work Done:\n– Finished working on the store module.\n– Added NFC scanning screens on the admin side.\n– Modified the orders list view and proposed an alternative version with a button instead of icons.\n– Created an order confirmation modal supporting multiple orders and multiple items.\n– On the user side, removed all UserID mentions from flows.\n– Refactored layout views and added developer comments for clarity and implementation guidance.Attachments / Links:\n—\n\n\nPlans for Tomorrow:\n– Review overall flows after finalization.\n– Proceed with next module or adjustments after team review.","Discord ID":"1169299236534366278","Employee ID":"86641"},{"Date":"2025-11-24","Verdict":"✅ OK","Issue":"","Employee Name":"Ulviyya A","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Current Status":"Available","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Discord Time":"8.17","CRM Time":"8.02","Discord Minutes":490,"CRM Status":"Active","First Check-in":"2025-11-24 06:59:03","Last Check-out":"2025-11-24 16:00:24","Report":"???? 24.11.2025 ????

HR Dashboard Design Review Meeting**Participants:** Polina (Design), Nikolay, Team members  **Duration:** Extended meeting session**Discussion Points:**- Reviewed employee activity dashboard requirements- Dashboard integrates Discord activity data and CRM time tracking- Purpose: Track employee productivity, identify underworked hours due to power outages, enable catch-up work scheduling**Current Dashboard Status:**- Deployed on Vercel (DD account, HR Dashboard repository)- Connected to GitHub with auto-deployment- Data sources: Google Sheets (Merge Report, Discord Report, CRM tabs)- Displays data for dates: 18, 19, 20, 21 (some gaps due to server issues)**Identified Issues &amp; Requirements:****UI/UX Improvements Needed:**- **Filter Functionality:** Needs improvement, unclear filtering logic- **Calendar Selection:** Add date range selection (day/week/month), calendar picker for specific dates- **Modal Cards:** Create employee detail modal with full information- **Report Display:**   - Reports are truncated (only 2 lines visible)  - Need markdown rendering support (reports come from Cursor/Dropbox in markdown)  - Add \"read more\" functionality or modal for full report- **Color Coding:**   - Separate leaves (different color) from violations (red)  - Red should be for violations only, not for employees on leave- **Leaderboard Clarity:**   - Show which of 3 parameters are met (Discord time, CRM time, report)  - Display specific issues clearly  - Make clickable to filter dashboard- **Heat Map:**   - Add legend at bottom  - Fix calendar display (should start with Monday)  - Improve color gradient clarity**Functional Issues:**- **Check vs Saspishes Logic:**   - Yellow status (e.g., Olya Kizilova) should appear in \"Check\" section but doesn't  - Need trigger to show all yellow in Check, all red in Saspishes- **Productivity Calculation:** Shows 100% even when report is missing (bug)- **Employee Cards:** Missing employee detail cards/modal- **Report Status:** \"Daily Report is missing or too short\" but clicking doesn't show details- **Project Employees:** Filter not showing project employees correctly (e.g., Maria Serotyuk)- **Card Heights:** Inconsistent heights due to report presence/absence**Data &amp; Logic Issues:**- **CRM Time Calculation:** Incorrect \"minus 1 hour break\" logic applied to all employees  - Should NOT deduct break for part-time employees  - Example bug: Check-in 6:00, Check-out 10:43 shows 368 minutes (should be more)  - Location: Dashboard codebase, needs fix- **Project Status:** Part-project employees should appear in project filter  - Status: \"part project\" should map to project filter  - Logic added for date 20, needs verification- **Discord Integration:** Added Discord icon for direct messaging (Friday addition)**Next Steps:**- Polina to create design mockups based on requirements- Implement UI improvements after design approval- Fix CRM time calculation logic- Improve filter and status logic---### 2. Task Management &amp; Delegation System**Task Collection:**- Collected 53 tasks from all departments (Week 3 onwards)- Tasks span multiple departments: AI, Design, Dev, LG, Video, Sales- Some tasks incorrectly classified (e.g., \"Appointment with client Wilhelm\" → should be Sales, not AI)**Current Status:**- Tasks categorized by department- Delegation mapping created but needs refinement- Task Manager structure needs review (some tasks not properly linked)**Issues Identified:**- Classification accuracy needs improvement- Department assignment errors exist- Task Manager not fully populated (some transcribed videos not in library)- Need better pattern matching for task classification**Next Steps:**- Review and refine classification logic- Improve department keyword/rules matching- Validate against Task Manager master file- Re-run delegation mapping with improved logic---### 3. Employee Profile Parsing &amp; Taxonomy Integration**Current Profile Structure:**- Basic CRM data: ID, name, age, country, start date- Contact info: personal/work emails, Discord ID, phone, Telegram, other messengers- Position block: Profession, Shift, Rate, Status- Skills and Tools (not yet tagged with IDs)**Requirements:**- Parse interview transcripts (check with Svitlana for location)- Extract skills and match to taxonomy (SKL-###)- Extract tools and match to taxonomy (TOL-###)- Assign profile IDs (PRF-###)- Link profiles to skills/tools with proper IDs**Data Sources:**- Employee profiles: `ENTITIES/TALENTS/Employees/profiles/`- Interview transcripts: Need to locate (check with Svitlana)- Resumes: Drive location (mentioned in meeting)- Existing profile markdown files**Taxonomy System:**- Skills need IDs (some have SKL-020, but need full audit)- Tools have IDs in Labres- Need to create/update master files for Tools.org- Taxonomy files in `ENTITIES/LIBRARIES/` and within folders**Challenges:**- Token limits constrain full automation- Manual work required for efficiency- Need to reduce file count for faster processing- Multiple iterations needed (3-4 full cycles per account for Tools alone)**Pilot Project:**- Start with Dasha's interview- Extract entities following PMT-004 workflow- Match to existing taxonomy or create new entries- Document methodology for reuse**Next Steps:**- Locate interview transcripts- Begin parsing Dasha's profile as pilot- Create parsing workflow documentation- Integrate with taxonomy system---### 4. Workflow System Migration**Current Issue:**- Duplicate systems: Old Workflow and new Milestone- Task 427: Need to migrate from Workflow to new system- Migration requires:  - Update all documentation references  - Update links in main Entity folder  - Update prompt files  - Ensure no data loss**Status:**- Migration paused (battery conservation)- Need systematic approach to avoid breaking references---### 5. Automation &amp; Infrastructure**GitHub/Dropbox Sync:**- Dropbox sync automation exists but disabled (token issues)- Entities folder needs daily sync to GitHub- Manual sync available via automation folder- Can be triggered manually when needed**Token Management:**- Multiple accounts: Cursor Pro (expires Nov 27), SubDGM, Claude accounts- Token limits affecting automation capabilities- Need to optimize token usage through better taxonomy structure**Composer Usage:**- Using Composer for task processing- Requires detailed step-by-step prompts- Claude can generate prompts for Composer- Working on delegation mapping improvements---### 6. Dashboard Development Requests**Entities/Task Manager/Research Dashboard:**- Requested dashboard for:  - Entities system health  - Task Manager status  - Research progress- Status: Not started, needs requirements definition**Financial Dashboard:**- Requested Friday, but prioritizing Talents dashboard first- Status: Deferred**Attendance Dashboard:**- Currently being designed by Olya- Integrates Discord and CRM data- Status: In progress---## Decisions Made1. **Prioritize Talents Dashboard** over Financial Dashboard2. **Start Employee Profile Parsing** with Dasha's interview as pilot3. **Fix CRM Time Calculation** - remove break deduction logic4. **Improve Task Classification** - refine delegation mapping5. **Design First, Then Implement** - Wait for Polina's design mockups before coding---## Blockers &amp; Issues### Current Blockers:1. **HR Dashboard Design:** Waiting for Polina's mockups2. **Employee Profile Data:** Need to locate interview transcripts3. **Token Limits:** Constraining full automation workflows4. **Task Classification:** Needs refinement for accuracy### Technical Issues:1. **CRM Time Calculation Bug:** Incorrect break deduction2. **Dashboard Filter Logic:** Not showing all relevant employees3. **Report Display:** Truncated, needs markdown rendering4. **Server Downtime:** Missing data for some dates (20th, 21st)---## Completed Tasks✅ Reviewed HR Dashboard requirements with team  ✅ Collected 53 tasks from all departments  ✅ Created task delegation mapping (needs refinement)  ✅ Discussed employee profile parsing approach  ✅ Identified CRM time calculation bug  ✅ Documented dashboard UI/UX requirements  ✅ Reviewed automation workflows and token management  ---## Pending Tasks### High Priority:1. **Fix CRM Time Calculation Logic** - Remove break deduction2. **HR Dashboard Design** - Wait for Polina's mockups, then implement3. **Employee Profile Parsing** - Start with Dasha's interview4. **Task Delegation Refinement** - Improve classification accuracy### Medium Priority:1. **Dashboard UI Improvements** - Filters, calendar, modals, markdown rendering2. **Entities/Task Manager Dashboard** - Define requirements3. **GitHub/Dropbox Sync** - Set up daily automation for Entities folder### Low Priority:1. **Workflow Migration** - Systematic migration from old to new system2. **Taxonomy Integration** - Complete ID assignment for all entities---## Next Steps for Tomorrow1. **Morning:**   - Review Polina's design progress (if available)   - Locate interview transcripts for employee profiles   - Begin CRM time calculation fix2. **Afternoon:**   - Start Dasha's profile parsing (pilot project)   - Refine task delegation classification logic   - Review and categorize remaining tasks3. **Ongoing:**   - Monitor token usage   - Continue taxonomy ID assignment   - Document processes as they're developed---## Notes &amp; Observations- **Token Constraints:** Significant limitation on automation capabilities, requiring manual work- **File Count Impact:** Reducing file count improves processing speed significantly- **Taxonomy Critical:** Proper ID assignment makes system work smoothly- **Design Dependency:** Dashboard improvements blocked on design mockups- **Data Quality:** Some gaps in data due to server issues, need manual processing---## Time Allocation- **Meeting/Discussion:** ~3-4 hours- **Task Review &amp;

Task Statistics Fix &amp; Validation- **Status:** ✅ Completed (with further refinement planned) &nbsp;- **Details:**&nbsp; - Reviewed previous Day 23 report and identified weaknesses in task completion detection.&nbsp; - Analyzed file structure variations across multiple employee folders.&nbsp; - Improved parsing logic for checkbox detection and heading handling.&nbsp; - Ran the script on several employee folders to validate statistics with real-world data.&nbsp; - Added error handling for missing files and malformed markdown so the script fails gracefully.- **Outcome:** &nbsp;&nbsp; - Statistics accuracy increased from ~60% to ~85% in test runs. &nbsp;&nbsp; - Script now handles more formats and edge cases without crashing. &nbsp;&nbsp; - Clear list of remaining limitations and the need for standardized file structures.### 2. AI Research &amp; Automation Planning for HR- **Status:** ✅ Completed &nbsp;- **Details:**&nbsp; - Collaborated with AI assistant to design a deep research prompt for **AI &amp; automation in HR and recruiting**.&nbsp; - Structured a comprehensive research brief covering AI tools, automation platforms, and HR-specific use cases.&nbsp; - Added a YouTube-focused research section for finding and analyzing videos about AI in HR, recruiting, and automation.&nbsp; - Designed a separate deep research prompt for building an **n8n + Dropbox + AI-based task manager** for employees.&nbsp; - Drafted the concept of an **HR bookmarklet** that sends post-interview files/pages to Dropbox and converts them to Markdown for future automations.- **Outcome Files:**&nbsp; - `HR Nov25/AI_HR_Automation_Research_Prompt.md`&nbsp; - YouTube research guide for AI/automation in HR (created previously in this session).### 3. Video Transcript Processing &amp; Prompt-Driven Implementation- **Status:** ✅ Completed &nbsp;- **Details:**&nbsp; - Processed training video transcripts `Video_024.md`, `Video_025.md`, and `Video_026.md` from the transcript library using the new task manager prompts/workflows.&nbsp; - Mapped video content to internal projects and designed similar execution flows for the task manager.&nbsp; - Carefully read and analyzed:&nbsp; &nbsp; - `NewPrompt.md`&nbsp; &nbsp; - `build_nealova_task_manager.py`&nbsp; &nbsp; - `nealova_task_manager.html`&nbsp; - Created an internal TODO list for necessary improvements:&nbsp; &nbsp; - Calendar color legend and clear UX meanings.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Hover tooltips for days (date, tasks, completion %).&nbsp; &nbsp; - Improved statistics (avg tasks/day, weekly completed, longest streak).&nbsp; &nbsp; - “How to do it” collapsible panels with videos and tools.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Better day header format and summary-only task display.&nbsp; - Implemented these changes in the Python generator and inline HTML/JS/CSS.&nbsp; - Re-ran the script until a successful build of the updated dashboard.- **Outcome:**&nbsp; - Updated `build_nealova_task_manager.py` with corrected statistics calculations and improved APP_STATE structure.&nbsp; - Updated `nealova_task_manager.html` with:&nbsp; &nbsp; - Two-column layout (stats + calendar left, selected day + tasks right).&nbsp; &nbsp; - Calendar legend (green/blue/dark-red/empty).&nbsp; &nbsp; - Hover tooltips on calendar cells.&nbsp; &nbsp; - Single-day rendering with compact task summaries and “How to do it” help panels using matched videos.&nbsp; - Confirmed script output with real numbers (total tasks, completed, progress, days with activity, videos/tools loaded).---## Issues &amp; Blockers1. **Phrase-Based Completion Detection Still Weak**&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Some completed tasks mentioned only in dailies/plans are not recognized.&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Cause:** Phrase-based detection is not yet rich enough and formats vary by employee.&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Plan:** Implement improved phrase patterns and/or require explicit completion markers in future guidelines.2. **Non-Standard File Structures Across Employees**&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Parsing logic must handle many exceptions; increases complexity and risk of incorrect stats.&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Plan:** Prepare and roll out **file structure standardization guidelines** (naming, folder structure, task markers).3. **HR Bookmarklet Concept Not Yet Implemented**&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Post-interview archiving to Dropbox/Markdown is still manual.&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Plan:** Use the new task in `task.md` to design full specification (bookmarklet behavior, backend API, Dropbox paths).---## Technical Details### Tools &amp; Files Used- Python task manager script: &nbsp;&nbsp; - `HR Nov25/Nealova Evgeniya/Nealova Task Manager/build_nealova_task_manager.py`- Generated dashboard: &nbsp;&nbsp; - `HR Nov25/Nealova Evgeniya/Nealova Task Manager/nealova_task_manager.html`- Prompts &amp; research documents: &nbsp;&nbsp; - `HR Nov25/Nealova Evgeniya/Nealova Task Manager/NewPrompt.md`&nbsp; - `HR Nov25/AI_HR_Automation_Research_Prompt.md`- Video transcripts: &nbsp;&nbsp; - `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS/RESEARCHES/02_TRANSCRIPTIONS/Video_024.md`&nbsp; - `.../Video_025.md`&nbsp; - `.../Video_026.md`### Current Script Capabilities (After Day 24)- ✅ Scans employee Week_X/Day folders and parses `task.md`, `plans.md`, `daily.md`.- ✅ Computes global and per-day statistics using only real parsed tasks.- ✅ Provides additional analytics:&nbsp; - Average tasks per active day.&nbsp; - Completed tasks for the selected week.&nbsp; - Longest streak of active days.- ✅ Generates HTML dashboard with:&nbsp; - Calendar + legend + tooltips.&nbsp; - Two-column layout with selected day details.&nbsp; - Compact task cards and collapsible “How to do it” sections.- ⚠️ Still sensitive to non-standard file structures and completion formats.---## Next Steps &amp; Recommendations### Immediate (Next Working Day)1. **Finalize Statistics Validation**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Finish cross-checking script statistics vs manual counts for several employees.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Document validation metrics and remaining false positives/negatives.2. **Blueprint Documentation**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Complete the blueprint describing:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Parsing logic and data structures.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Statistics formulas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- UI layout and interaction patterns.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Use this as the base for automation contracts and future dev work.3. **Bookmarklet Specification**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Flesh out the HR bookmarklet technical brief:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Frontend behavior.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Backend API contract.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Markdown template and Dropbox path rules.### Short Term (This Week)1. **Phrase-Based Completion Detection**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Improve detection of completion phrases in dailies/plans.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Decide if explicit markers will be required and document them.2. **Video-Based Training Instructions**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Once statistics are stable, start linking tasks to videos using transcript-based matching.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Reuse the pattern created from Video 24–26 for other training videos.3. **Standardization Guidelines**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Draft and align on folder/file naming conventions for all HR employees.&nbsp; &nbsp;- Reduce parsing complexity by enforcing a single standard going forward.---## Notes- Work for Day 24 significantly tightened the feedback loop between **prompt → code → dashboard**, using real training videos and live script testing.- The Nealova dashboard now serves as a **reference implementation** for future employee dashboards and HR automation experiments.- The AI &amp; automation research prompts and YouTube guide will support both HR and technical teams in expanding this system with n8n, Dropbox, and AI helpers.","Discord ID":"1332311305289465900","Employee ID":"83953"},{"Date":"2025-11-24","Verdict":"📦 PROJECT","Issue":"External Project","Employee Name":"Sergii T","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Current Status":"Project","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Discord Time":"2.03","CRM Time":"7.92","Discord Minutes":122,"CRM Status":"Active","First Check-in":"2025-11-24 11:17:40","Last Check-out":"2025-11-24 20:12:24","Report":"24.11.2025 Робота на проєкті парт тайм.
