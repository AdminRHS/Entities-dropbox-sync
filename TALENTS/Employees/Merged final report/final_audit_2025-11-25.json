Criteria### Completed ✅- [x] All 9 milestones documented with examples- [x] All 4 core automation scripts written- [x] Master orchestration script created- [x] Comprehensive README and installation guide- [x] Collection script tested with real data- [x] Time savings analysis completed- [x] Cost-benefit analysis completed- [x] Risk assessment completed### Pending ⏳- [ ] Python dependencies installed- [ ] API keys configured- [ ] Full end-to-end test completed- [ ] Production pilot (5-10 employees)- [ ] Team training completed- [ ] First 3-5 production runs monitored- [ ] Full deployment to 60+ employees---## Lessons Learned### What Went Well ✅1. **Systematic Approach** - Breaking into 9 milestones made complex workflow manageable2. **Taxonomy Integration** - Using ISO codes from ENTITIES/TAXONOMY provided structure3. **Real Examples** - Including actual employee profiles made documentation practical4. **Automation Focus** - Identifying high-value automation targets (84% time reduction)5. **Documentation First** - Created comprehensive docs before automation enabled better design### Challenges Overcome ????1. **Complexity** - Simplified with milestone separation and standalone guides2. **Naming Consistency** - Standardized on TST-### (not TSK-###) throughout3. **Folder Organization** - Moved from TSM-007_GUIDES to ENTITIES/DAILIES for better structure4. **Multiple File Types** - Designed collection to handle ALL .md files, not just daily.md5. **Balance** - Found right mix of automation (84%) vs manual review (16%)### Best Practices Applied ✨1. **DRY Principle** - Master script orchestrates, doesn't duplicate logic2. **Error Handling** - All scripts handle failures gracefully3. **Dry-Run Mode** - Preview before execution in all scripts4. **Documentation** - README, INSTALLATION, and inline comments5. **Modularity** - Each script can run independently6. **Testing** - Limit flags and dry-run for safe testing---","Discord
