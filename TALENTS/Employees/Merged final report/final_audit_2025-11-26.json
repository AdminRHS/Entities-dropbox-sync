Team Coordination - Mascot Design Requirements &amp; Black Friday Review&nbsp; 2. Portfolio Review - Mascot Character Selection Session&nbsp; 3. Course Carousel Review - Lovable Platform Training Content&nbsp; 4. CRM Dashboard Update - Bug Fixes &amp; Design Planning&nbsp; 5. Team Capacity Planning - Task Assignments &amp; HR Updates&nbsp; 6. Budget Discussion - Tool Subscriptions &amp; Department Priorities### Documentation &amp; Guidelines Established:- **AI Tool Usage Guidelines** - Documented Runway gen4/gen4 turbo restrictions (credit management), ElevenLabs voice consistency requirements- **Daily Documentation Process** - Implemented new workflow: Dropbox uploads + Discord #media posts + separate prompts document- **Interview Preparation Support** - Helped prepare Anastasiia for Wednesday 12:00 portfolio presentation### Technical Updates:- **CRM Dashboard Enhancements Reviewed** - Discussed logic bug fixes (No Report display, calendar start date correction) and upcoming design beautification phase---## 2️⃣ Challenges &amp; Solutions – Issues faced and how they were solved### Challenge 1: Runway Credit Depletion Crisis**Issue:** Team consumed most Runway credits (2200 → 35) in one day by accidentally using gen3/gen2 models not covered by unlimited plan**Solution Implemented:**- Enforced strict policy: Runway gen4 and gen4 turbo models ONLY- Established habit: Always verify model selection before each generation- Education: Team reminded that gen4 turbo is actually faster than gen3- Model can auto-switch between sessions - now checking is mandatory muscle memory### Challenge 2: Portfolio Uniformity Problem**Issue:** Current mascot work shows repeated patterns - forest backgrounds dominate, similar character poses, lacks diverse styles needed for professional portfolio**Solution Implemented:**- Created comprehensive component library system to force variety- Requirement: 50+ radically different backgrounds (no environment repetition)- Mandate: Each pose must be different body position (sitting, flying, crouching, etc.)- Strategy: Organize environments into categories (Natural, Mystical, Elemental, Unusual) to ensure diversity### Challenge 3: Text-Heavy Social Content**Issue:** Tendency to overload social posts with text causes readability issues and excessive animation credits consumption**Solution Implemented:**- New guideline: Minimize text on visuals, move details to voiceover narration- Safe zone enforcement: 200px top, 300px bottom (no important content in platform UI zones)- Font minimum: 45pt in Figma for mobile readability- Strategy: Visual storytelling + voiceover instead of text-heavy slides### Challenge 4: Modern Technology in Fantasy Settings**Issue:** Designers defaulting to showing computers/devices in mascot scenes despite \"fantasy world only\" requirement**Solution Implemented:**- Creative substitutions documented:&nbsp; - Laptop → Magical scroll or glowing stone&nbsp; - Monitor → Water surface reflection or crystal vision&nbsp; - Phone → Enchanted leaf or whisper stone&nbsp; - Camera → Magic viewfinder or light-capturing crystal- Requirement: Characters must be actively performing profession-specific activities using fantasy-world equivalents### Challenge 5: Employee Retention Issues**Issue:** 6 departures this week including sudden quits without notice (Veronika quit after one day of tasks)**Solution Discussed:**- Communication gap identified: Need proactive quit notifications from HR to hiring channels- Team waited 25 minutes before discovering through recruiters- Ongoing evaluation of remaining 6 designers for performance and availability### Challenge 6: Documentation Compliance**Issue:** New requirement for daily Dropbox uploads + Discord posts + prompts documents adds overhead**Solution Implemented:**- Clear template provided for prompts documentation (tool, prompt, settings, purpose, result)- Examples shared from previous weeks (Week_4/24, Week_4/25)- Requirement: Even incomplete work gets uploaded with screenshots- Post finished work only to Discord #media, but all work to Dropbox---## 3️⃣ Tools &amp; Software Used – Platforms and apps worked with### AI Generation Tools:- **Runway** (gen4, gen4 turbo models) - Video generation, background creation- **ElevenLabs** - Voice generation for mascot characters (consistency per character required)- **ChatGPT/Claude** - Prompt writing, task planning, content generation- **Midjourney** - Image generation (referenced for character work)- **Gemini** - AI assistant, research support### Design Tools:- **Figma** - Primary design tool, carousel creation, mockups (45pt minimum font standard)- **Photoshop** - Image editing- **Illustrator** - Vector graphics- **Canva** - Template-based designs (some team members using)### Collaboration &amp; Productivity:- **Discord** - Team communication, #media channel for work sharing- **Dropbox** - File storage, daily work uploads (Design Nov25/Kucherenko Iuliia/Week_4/26/)- **Loom** - Training video recordings and documentation- **NotebookLM** - Research and organization### Development Tools:- **CRM System** - Internal dashboard (attendance tracking, employee reporting)- **VS Code/Cursor** - Code editing (for dashboard work by some designers)### Platforms:- **Lovable Platform** - Website/app creation tool (subject of course carousel)- **Instagram/TikTok/Facebook** - Social media distribution channels- **LinkedIn** - Professional content sharing### Budget Discussion Tools:- **Perplexity** - Research tool (evaluated but decided against additional subscription)- **Framer** - Website builder (noted as expensive: $40-50/month equivalent)- **Replit** - Development environment (mentioned for future experiments)---## 4️⃣ Plans for Tomorrow – What's next on the agenda### High Priority (Immediate):1. **Begin Mascot Background Library Creation**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Start generating initial 10-15 diverse background environments&nbsp; &nbsp;- Focus on 4 priority professions: UX Designer, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, Lead Generator&nbsp; &nbsp;- Document each: Visual file + environment name + full prompt + profession compatibility&nbsp; &nbsp;- Organize in folder structure: Natural/Mystical/Elemental/Unusual categories&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Target:** Complete first batch by end of week2. **Daily Documentation Compliance**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Upload all work from today to Dropbox (Week_4/26 folder)&nbsp;

Мы с какого-то времени очень давно пытаемся перейти на искусственный интеллект в тех или иных способах, где-то более удачно, где-то менее удачно. На каком-то этапе попытки должны превратиться в регулярные действия, в регулярную привычку.Этот этап настал. Больше пытаться или ходить по кругу и пытаться внедрить что-то напоминаниями и так далее больше не представляется возможным. Есть такой тренд, если посмотреть последние выставки глобальных компаний, то называется AI First Company.Что это даёт? Это даёт доступ к аналитическим данным компаний и позволяет их анализировать. Но это глобально для меня. Вместо того, чтобы ходить и с каждым созваниваться, я могу увидеть всю картину, пройдясь по записи.Второе. Для вас каждое, любое действие можно найти на YouTube видеоролик, как оно делается. Для этого мы создали систему ресерчей.Нововведения, инновации и так далее они выходят в рамках буквально одного-двух дней. Мы хотим пользоваться последними инструментами, мы хотим сразу научиться, как ими пользоваться. И одного человека в компании, который делает вот эту инновационную интеграцию, недостаточно.Физически не хватает ни сил, нет. Кто-то больше, кто-то меньше. Это первая тематика сегодняшнего созвона.Это AI. Для того, чтобы искусственный интеллект работал, у него должны быть записи. Записи должны быть не в формате, типа «я сегодня был на работе».Этого недостаточно. Он не может получить оттуда данные, он не может отследить прогресс по определённым проектам, он не может определить, где мы в чём застряли и так далее. Естественно, когда он получает пустой файл, то вообще ему нечего сказать.Ни мне, ни по отделу, ни так далее. Я понимаю, что привычка — штука сложная. Она выработалась годами.Годами мы ничего не писали, сколько я не просил там и так далее. Пришло время это поменять. Мы осветили, мы сказали применение искусственных интеллектов.Это значит, что мы за последнюю неделю потратили огромное количество времени на то, чтобы проверять у людей, установлен ли VS Code, включен ли Dropbox, вообще есть ли Cloud Extension. И по кругу были задействованы административные ресурсы, которые ходили по людям и проверяли, а вообще хотя бы там есть курсор, есть Extension или нет. Вместо того, чтобы развивать нашу компанию, двигать какому-то прогрессу, внедрять новые какие-то инструменты, мы бегаем и занимаемся ерундой.Типа вы сегодня покушали, а вы умывались, а вы чистили зубы и так далее. Для взрослых людей, которых мы наняли на работу, для которых выходят на работу, это даже не знаю, как характеризовать. Work environment – это третья тематика.И четвертое – это у кого есть проблемы с электричеством. Сейчас выспикаем. Есть проблемы с электричеством.Когда человек выходит на работу, у которого есть проблемы с электричеством, то оставшееся время, когда электричество есть, очень бы хотелось, чтобы люди работали, они освещали опять путь по электричеству. То есть у меня в записях электричество, электричество, электричество. Куда двигается наша компания? Куда двигается отдел? Что мы в отделе делаем? Где какой прогресс? Никакого power out range.Не нужно это записывать. Достаточно знать о том, что у нас есть эта проблема, чтобы не висела она везде. Теперь вы знаете, у кого есть проблемы с электричеством и так далее.Нужно отрабатывать. А я вечерами почему-то сижу там один-два человека. Как это? Электричество, электричество, а обед по расписанию.Так не подходит? Мы внедрили обед. Вопрос не в том, чтобы вы перерабатывали, хотя это должно тоже оплачиваться и будет оплачиваться. Вопрос в том, чтобы часы, которые потерялись, мы очень лояльно относимся.То есть нет электричества хорошо, нет возможности работать окей. Надо отработать просто. Я извиняюсь.Наоборот. Хорошо, спасибо. Да, хотелось бы, чтобы вам нравилось то, что вы делаете.Чтобы вам тоже хотелось развиваться вместе с нами. Не тянуть, не упираться ногами и руками в тормоза и пытаться всеми способами затормозить и сказать, я против. Ну скажите, что я против.Придите, скажите, я не буду записывать. Я не буду использовать искусственный интеллект. Я хочу работать по старинке.Хочу работать руками. Не хочу ничего писать. Не могу ничего писать.Разучился. Последний раз учился в школе 20 лет назад. Что такое писать, я не помню.Анализировать и улучшаться я не хочу. Но это будет хотя бы прямой, честный разговор. Но тратить время на то, чтобы бегать, перепроверять, выстраивать системы для того, чтобы обнаружить, что вы не хотите и не будете писать и так далее, я больше этим заниматься не хочу.Мы отнесемся с уважением и благодарностью за все время, отработанное у нас компанией. Отблагодарим и так далее. Но в этом году этот этап врачной работы завершается окончательно.Кто не может писать, не может читать, перечитывать и так далее, извините, больше просто выполненная работа втихую, в этом она не востребована. Делайте, пожалуйста, выводы. Мы сказали еще раз, искусственный интеллект, использование, анализ своих, для чего используется искусственный интеллект? Это я что-то делаю, я записываю, для тех, кто да, записывает, для тех, кто да, читает.Я сделал что-то, мы каждый день совершенствуем, есть такой у вас в корне папки, main, prompt, сейчас уже седьмая версия. Сделайте анализ своего дня. Это у меня просьба к вам, ко всем, сделать анализ своих дней и поставить репорты в главную папку отдела, department report, за 24-е число и за 25-е.До этого, в предыдущей неделе мы сделали это с Колей, двух людей на всю компанию не хватает ни рук, ни времени, работать по ночам, по выходным и так далее, для того, чтобы... не получается. Вернее, получается, но это немыслимо. Поэтому каждый делает свои отчеты.В этих отчетах, при помощи искусственного интеллекта, это стартовая точка, мы спрашиваем, что мы можем делать лучше, что мы можем раскопать. По поводу искусственного интеллекта, понятно, тут анализ, daily report, это самый первый шаг. Дальше, сохранение записи.Вы общаетесь с искусственным интеллектом, вы просите их залогировать, вы разрабатываете что-то, он вам ответил. Вы или копируете его чат, или пишете ему «сохрани мне лог 5», «сохрани мне промпты». Последовательность работы с искусственным интеллектом начинается с того, что вы сначала просите его «создай мне промпт».Любое действие, которое вы хотите делать, вы говорите сначала «создай мне промпт», он создает промпт. Вы перечитываете этот промпт детально, посрочно, смотрите, что всё совпадает, что правильное название, тыкайте его в нужные папки, которые ему нужны для контекста. Если контекста нет, то вы начинаете планировать создание контекста.Контекст — это что-то, что улучшает качество выдачи искусственного интеллекта в разы, и он действительно сможет говорить о нашей компании и о том, как у нас всё это работает. Ваше выступление, давайте каждое по два слова скажете, и это будет короткий звонок сегодня. Давайте по алфавиту.— Давай я это сделаю. Первое. Если очень легко подсумировать, вас никто не заставляет делать ту работу, которую вы не делали до этого.Но имеется в виду какие-то… Если, например, кто-то занимался блоггалтерией, никто не просит заниматься создавать видео, хотя, в принципе, это тоже было бы неплохо, как контент. Но оптимизировать свою работу через E. И на этом этапе всё выглядит очень просто. Вам нужно первое — логировать все эти вещи, все вещи, которые вы делаете, то бишь просто писать в отчёт.Очень легко. Те же отчёты, которые вы писали, только в более расширенном. С записями виск проплыва, с записями того, что вы сделали, чтобы мы могли просто анализировать, куда компания движется.Не потому, что не для какого-то тотального контроля, а для того, чтобы понимать, как нам стать лучше. И второе — в этих инструментах, которые вы делаете на ежедневной основе, использовать современные инструменты. Сорвиндсорф, код, всё остальное.Запись блокнотов — это минимальное требование. Есть ещё следующий уровень. Как я могу это сделать лучше? Как это делают лукохи и искусство интеллекта? Или ресёрчи, дип-ресёрчи, джемини, GPT или локальные модели.Мы говорили уже несколько раз про парсинг видосов. Поиск в YouTube видосов. Папка называется Ventities.В Task Manager есть ресёрч. Там промпты по поводу того, как искать в YouTube видосы по вашей тематике. Естественно, что если в блокноте ничего не записано, то вам нечего будет искать.Искусственный интеллект не подскажет. Но спрашивать искусственный интеллект, как разбить мне по шагам, разбить мне по этапам, как сделать мою работу лучше, скачать инструкции, которые у нас были на Google Drive, положить у себя в папочке, тыкнуть в эту папочку и сказать, мы это делаем вот так вот. Инструкции немножко устаревшие.Можешь мне их переформатировать и создать промпт для искусственного интеллекта, чтобы он имел контекст, дал контекст искусственному интеллекту и спросил, как это сделать лучше. Это уже второй класс. Не заоблачные требования.Просто я смотрю дальше. Нам нужно внедрять рекламу, нам нужно внедрять СММ, нам нужно внедрять новые инструменты. Но как мы это можем делать, если мы не можем внедрить... Это будет последний мой инпут.Если мы что-то просим... Я рассчитываю, мечтаю, чтобы мы придём к тому времени, когда попросил, и на следующий день это уже внедрено и в работе. То есть я ищу новые какие-то пути улучшения и так далее. Нужна поддержка команды.Если мы новые инструменты и новые технологии сможем внедрять в течение нескольких дней, мы будем расти семимильными шагами. Но если на новый инструмент нам надо две-три недели или месяц ходить и напоминать, и спросить, пожалуйста, пожалуйста, то... Я закончил. Давайте по два слова буквально.Если коротко, то нужно делать конструктивные записи через WhisperFlow, чтобы можно было их хорошо проанализовать через чат, чтобы было видно, как проработана работа, чтобы можно было складывать планы, и их потом и оновливать, и проводить. Да, проанализировать прогресс и смотреть ещё, собирать с искусственного интеллекта общие знания. Ну да, это само собой.Контекст, да, и инструкции скачивать. Да, там же всё скачено, инструкции у меня почти все оновлены. Спасибо.Настя Пасична. Да, надо проанализировать папки за 24-25 числа, используя этот промпт. Также сохранять записи, которые мы делаем через ИИ, и оптимизировать работу, всё записывать, всё сохранять.Да, и внедряем ещё ресёрч хотя бы по одному видосу в день. Вы находите в YouTube по вашей тематике, по вашему спектру работы, рекомендации, какие видео опубликованы за последние 30 или 50 дней с использованием искусственного интеллекта, автоматизации и так далее. Спасибо.Анна Бурда. Можете не только по поводу проговорить, по поводу того, что мы говорили, но и, может, свой какой-то инпут, отзыв. Ну, в загальном, мне нравится то, что мы внедряем, где мы записываем свои планы, свою проработанную работу, то есть можно отзывать, что мы сделали, и как где улучшать, и над чем мы проработали этот тиждень.Я понимаю, для чего это. И, да, проводить анализ, самоанализ, и изучение чего-то нового – это всегда круто, поэтому нужно попробовать всё. Спасибо.Можно попросить по литгенам увеличивать количество информации, которая поступает от литгенов, даже если это будет в ущерб успеваемости на первых порах, но чтобы они, например, свои диалоги, профили или ещё что-то копировали себе в блокноте, чтобы мы могли увидеть более детально, чтобы нам не требовалось просмотр их экрана, а могли сразу увидеть. Ну, это как эксперимент, я не знаю, может, вы смодифицируете эту просьбу и как-то чуть-чуть протестите, сделайте полегче, чтобы у литгенов появлялось больше контекста, чем просто я сделал 40. Я сделал 40, я сделал 50.Но кого? Какие должности? Какие компании? В какой стране? И так далее. У искусственного интеллекта пока нет доступа к CRM, проанализировать записи, хотя, Оля, может, в перспективе мы можем вытаскивать по одному человеку, по одному литгену. Кто кого сделал? Мы можем подумать над этим? Да, мы подумаем, как это сделать попроще.Подумаем. Спасибо. Дан.Да, идея с анализами сразумела, провести анализ, чтобы сработать какие-то выяснения из проработанной работы. Я думаю, что было бы классно, если у литгонератора, например, за день закрылся звонок, ну, не закрылся, а назначился звонок, чтобы даже в день прописывать, возможно, индустрию, или, возможно, как проходила коммуникация с клиентом, как успешный кейс, и потом с тем временем все эти анализы собрать в какую-то базу наиболее успешную. Хорошо.Еще у нас по литгонерации будут в планах в ближайшее время постинг. Вот. И мы для клиентов, с которыми назначили звонок, будем делать какие-то, генерировать там картинки, там, или еще демо, демо-примеры, поэтому нужно будет взаимодействовать с другими отделами.То есть у вас появился звонок, и мы идем там к дизайнерам, или к видеомонтажерам, или к разработчикам, и смотрим, делаем гей-прессер по этому клиенту, смотрим, что ему потенциально может быть нужно, и делаем ему демо-пример. Но это планы на будущее, я более детально расскажу. Спасибо.Спасибо, да. Да. Так, ну, документировать все, каждый шаг, инструкции хранить актуальными, возможно, делать какие-то туториалы по каким-то рутинным задачам.Также важно, мне кажется, от коммуникации в отделе тоже выделять какие-то глобальные планы, тоже их, естественно, записывать, и чтобы анализом можно было выделять структуру вот этих глобальных планов тоже, не только рутины. Желательно это все прогонять искусственным интеллектом, то есть вы, когда написали свои планы с инструкции, то вы его прогнали, например, через стандпромт 7 или еще что-то, или спросили, как можно это улучшить, и посмотреть, что он понял из записи. Если он понял что-то неправильно, очень важно ему дать обратную связь и подкорректировать, чтобы потом эта ошибка не тянулась дальше во всей системе.Да. Ну, опять-таки, да, это давать больше контекста и объяснений, потому что, да, сухое просто констатирование фактов не всегда срабатывает так, как нужно. Да, он не до конца понимает, и главное перечитывать, перечитывать, перечитывать, еще раз перечитывать его выдачу, как он понял ваши записи, как он понял детали, он понял что-то, другой человек тоже не понял.Спасибо. Юля. Ну, мы через Antigravity Daily Proceed делаем, но мы делаем, только, правда, пока что администрация, где-то с прошлой недели, наверное, мы начинали это делать.Поэтому как бы это мы… Ну, мы делаем конкретно по своей работе, типа я по своей, Вильгельм по своей, Свет по своей. Вот, поэтому теперь еще нужно добавить по всему отделу, чтобы делалось то же самое по всей папке за каждый день. Единственный вопрос все-таки как бы, чем лучше все-таки пользоваться? Курсором, Antigravity или вес-кодом, или в принципе без разницы, потому что у нас все три установлено.И вот вчера, например, была проблема Antigravity, отказывался работать через Gemini 3 Pro, через модель Haya, и отказывался работать через Quotz.net. Вот у меня, когда я писала отчет, есть какие-то вот то, что, может быть, вы, когда делали эти отчеты, выявили, какая из этих моделей лучше работает, какие-то рекомендации есть в этом плане? Самое лучшее на данный момент работает, это Cloud Extension, его можно установить и в курсоре, и в Antigravity, и в вес-коде. У нас установлен Cloud Extension. Но токены там заканчиваются, но есть хорошая сторона, то, что они обновляются через 3-4 часа.Когда мы просто поустанавливали в Antigravity, основной посыл был проверить, как работает модель Gemini 3 Pro Haya. Лог не работает. По Gemini и Antigravity тоже надо переключать аккаунты.Работает это, в чате пишите slash login и тыкайте в другой браузер корпоративный, на котором есть, и перелогиниваетесь. Это не сбрасывает вам чаты, ничего, вы продолжаете с этим же чатом работать, только с другого аккаунта, где есть токены. Дэйли репорт, анализ предыдущего дня, будет обязательство каждого из вас на ежедневной основе.То есть вы сегодня делаете за вчера, за вчера вы, скорее всего, не делали, за вчера, за позавчера вы тоже не делали. Поэтому сегодня, за понедельник и за вторник индивидуальные отчеты каждого человека, и потом глобальная департамента. Какой прогресс? Вы уже можете посмотреть, кто не пишет, вы можете посмотреть, у кого мало деталей, вы можете давать обратную связь.Не обязательно доводить это до состояния, в котором... И еще есть вопросик. По поводу закидки в ежедневной папке картинок и видео. Реально прям так делать, чтобы мы забили дробокс? Или достаточно будет ссылок, где оно хранится на Google Drive? Так как мы будем просто архивировать за неделю.Но я бы предпочел, чтобы внутри папки департамента была какая-нибудь папка медиа, в котором был бы лог. И когда ты закидываешь картинку, то ты висперфлоуом записываешь, говоришь, допиши мне в лог картинка ID №137. Она для задания такого-то, такого-то.Промп для него лежит там-то, там-то. Детали, просто картинки недостаточно. Какому проекту это относится? Какому клиенту? Какому заданию? Каким промптом генерировали? В каком инструменте генерировали? И какие были сложности, недочеты? Сколько времени заняло? И еще что-то в этом роде.Хорошо, мы хотя бы с чего-то начнем, а то как-то сильно много всего сразу. Ну, с картинок, в смысле, я имею в виду, да. С информацией.Информацией, информацией картинок. Как ее сделать лучше? Вот я посмотрел за вчера, что вы вчера говорили. На всех картинках стоит лицом портрет на этот.У какого-то дизайнера будут идеи по поводу того, чтобы сделать его сидящим, лежащим, там, я не знаю, рыбачащим, готовящим еду или так далее. Но он постесняется прийти к вам, потому что вы сидите там, разговариваете между собой, там, типа администрация там и все такое. Постеснялась.Ко мне тоже не придет. А написать бы, может быть, написал. Значит, нужно делать тогда, чтобы еще был анализ, просматривали дизайнеры работы других дизайнеров, ну, то есть сами, и какое-нибудь свое мнение давали по поводу, как бы они это усовершенствовали? Это было бы идеально.Это предлагала Ксения, тренинг-баддис, то есть по парам разбивать, и один проверяет работу другого, за счет этого записывает виспер-флоу и собирает комментарии, что можно было бы лучше, какие-то инпуты, которые ты сразу не увидел. Но принцип остается одним и тем же принципом. Мы хотим совершенствоваться или не хотим совершенствоваться? Мы довольны своими результатами и считаем, что это наша конечная точка, или мы изо дня в день будем просто становиться на 1% лучше? Для того, чтобы стать лучше, самый лучший помощник на данный момент — это спросить искусственный интеллект.Его получится спросить, только если мы полностью запишем, продиктуем контекст. Для чего? Какое было задание? Где было это задание? Какой пром ты использовал? Какие искусственный интеллект ты использовал? И так далее, а потом не надо было сидеть неделями и собирать это всё. Да? Хорошо, попробуем внедрить.Единственное, что прям всё, вряд ли прям быстро получится. Может, неделя-две, какие-то просто нюансы всё равно будут, которые нужно будет дополнять на дропбоксе. 100%, 100%.Оно должно двигаться куда-то. Почуть-чуть лучше, без проблем. Но желательно завышать планку.Не сразу требовать меньше, а сразу требовать больше. Понятно, но просто всё равно, по примеру того, что мы делали уже на две недели, что-то всё равно пропускаем, пока что возвращаемся. То есть сразу прям не получится.Один из хороших способов, который у меня не получается, потому что у меня токенов не хватает проанализировать всех людей, все отделы и так далее, это ежедневно давать, вписывать людям на следующий день. То есть помимо анализа предыдущего дня, на следующий день вы уже знаете, что следующее число — это 27-ое. Создайте сегодня у людей папку 27-ое или в 27-ом файле.Напишите «туду» или «планс», или «рулз». И создайте, и напишите прямо искусственному интеллекту, даже не людям. Когда заливаешь картинку, добавь следующие детали, дайте ему идеи.И напишите там эти 10 пунктов, которые я продиктовал. Лучше, чем голосом. Намного лучше.Хорошо с первого дня не получится, со второго получится. Не получится со второго, получится с пятого. Лишь бы видно было, что люди стараются и хотят.Кто не хочет с нами двигаться, не хочет с нами развиваться, не хочет совершенствовать, не хочет внедрять ничего, против этого всего, со всей благодарностью и уважением. Да нет, у нас в этом плане все делают, просто что не все, как составные части, прям забывают про некоторые части, что добавить нужно и так далее. Давайте внедрим правила внутри этого.Всё равно это дело должно делаться по итогу искусственным интеллектом. Если у искусственного интеллекта будет папочка с правилами, или файл с правилами, он будет его читать при выполнении задания и будет им следовать, и говорить человеку. А ответь мне, пожалуйста, на вот эти следующие вопросы.А ты для чего делала эту картинку? А ты её запостила или нет? Ты её сделала. А ты её показывала кому-то? Верификация, сдача. В последнее время ко мне никто не приходит.Мы хотим внедрить смены, когда вы созваниваетесь. Кого надо мне подписать? Меня, пожалуйста, меня. Я писалась одним дотменем.Если будут прописаны эти правила искусственный интеллект сам будет задавать вопросы. Среди них вопрос по поводу... Какие цифры у тебя? У меня не было цифр. У меня оно зашло.Я просто хочу ещё и виспер. У меня с виспером были проблемы. Ну, видимо, для виспера цифры просятся.А, 99. 99. У меня уже не было 99.Ну, давай сейчас договорим уже. Отпущу людей и там... Ну, ладно. Приходите на звонки.Мы попробуем сделать смены. Но, опять же, нет у нас пока администратора, который бы назначил звонки. Давайте договоримся за какое-то время.Раз в неделю, два раза в неделю. Каждый человек должен прийти, рассказать, показать. Классно.Даже если у нас получилось записать, и мы пробуем анализировать искусственным интеллектом, придите, покажите, посоветуйтесь. Приходить, показывать нужно не только на конечном этапе. Желательно приходить на 10% прогресса.То есть, написали вы пром, расписали свои планы, сами прочитали. Пожалуйста, не скидывайте мне первую генерацию, которую вы даже не считали, и сказать, вот это вот мой план. Это так не подходит.Я рассчитываю на то, что вы умеете читать, поправлять и доводить это до того состояния, которое вам нравится. У нас будут такие планы. Будем делать то-то, то-то, то-то.Как думаешь? Я теперь подправлю или согласуем? Все, поехали дальше. Готовы на половину? Не надо ждать конечного. Он еще плохой и так далее.В принципе, понятно, что сделать не так. Ну, придите, покажите. Но чтобы не я за вами ходил.Можете отправлять ко мне людей. Можем согласовать конкретное время. Мы поняли, мы вчера про это говорили.Да. Кто следующий? Ксения. Класс.Только хотел сказать. Спросите у искусственного интеллекта, что можно сделать лучше. Спасибо.Спасибо. И подумайте, да, по поводу деталей. Да, да, да.У нас уже есть план. Спасибо. Оль, ты тогда покажешь этот отчет, чтобы я там на одной коленке... Расскажешь? Да.Так будет виднее. Мы собираем данные по рабочим часам и по репортам. Из CRM и из Дискорда.И смотрим, кто сколько работал, кто сколько не работал. Связано с отключением света, с тем, что мы хотим внедрить смены для тех, у кого долго нет света, дать возможность отработать вечером. Или тогда, когда есть свет.И так далее. Но в любом случае, рабочий день для фуллтайма 8 часов, для партайма 4 часа. Люди должны работать и должны лагировать свою работу и писать отчеты по проделанной работе.Все это дело мы собираем и смотрим, у кого сколько получается, у кого сколько не получается. Все это дальше пойдет в дешборд, который мы доделаем на днях. Но смысл в том, что уже на данном этапе видно, что есть некоторые проблемы.У кого-то не хватает репортов, у кого-то не хватает времени в Дискорде, у кого-то не хватает времени в CRM. Это будет яснее, когда я буду получать еще рейд. Но, тем не менее, даже с этой логикой уже есть... Кажется, с этой логикой есть уже некоторые моменты, на которые стоит обратить внимание.Шорт-лист людей, у которых есть или несоответствие по времени, ожидаемому, сколько они должны отработать, или нет репорта, или нет ни одного, ни второго, ни третьего. Прочитаешь имена? Да. И вот эту девочку ей надо будет тогда поправить статус в CRM, потому что она светится как available, и система ее распознает, соответственно, как available, и ожидает от нее 8 часов работы, а у нее 0 часов, потому что она presale.Нужно будет изменить ей статус. Литген Карина Н. Леонора на выходных. Вика Реконвальд.Она вроде работает, но записей не было в CRM. И репорта. Юлю пропускаем.Катя репорты. Аня. Ожидалось 4 часа, но по... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 CRM-ки 0 часов.Учтем. Это только за понедельник, или за понедельник и вторник? Нет, это понедельник, вторник должно было быть. Да, это понедельник, вторник.Учтем про 25-е. Учтем. Там еще надо будет, наверное, определять, на автоматическом линк, ребята.Не верно. Внедрить. Что? Вместе разобрать.Выходные надо как-то внедрить. Внедрить, внедрить. Куда внедрить выходные? Ну, например, как Илеонора, например, у него выходные, да, он считает, что ее не было на работе, а у нее официальная процедурная неделя.Илеонора с выходным, все нормально. Илеонора, Лив. Лив Рейд один.А что неправильно считает Ольга? А что у вас считает время? Ты только что показал документы. Что у вас там считает? СРМ? СРМ и Дискорд. Открой.Курсор. Что это за параметры? Наверху заголовки. Средняя СРМ.Средняя СРМ. У меня не может быть 7 и 1 часов СРМ, у меня каждый день 8 часов и больше. Играет 9 со сработным работным.А, ну оно отнимает 1 час с перерывом. Перерыв отнимается автоматом. Автоматом, да.Это то, что у меня было. Ну, вот если 8 проработало, он автоматом отнимает 1 час с перерывом. А кто, например, 4 часа работает, у меня такая же штука была, что я работаю, например, 4 часа, а он у меня отнял 1 час и засчитал как 3. Да, но так Оля там уже подправила.Оля, может не будем отнимать этот час сейчас? Можем не отнимать час. Кто-то без перерыва работает. А навещу его взагали ведь не маты? Ну, работаем, это пока проба пера.Предполагалось 1 час с перерывом. Ну, да, 1 час с перерывом, но все равно 8 часов. Когда человек уходит на перерыв, он выключает третий CRM.Да, там есть кнопочка break. Или не выключает. Но он автоматом, это программульник, автоматом неважно, выключаешь ты, не выключаешь.Она автоматом отнимает таймер, да. Даже я свои данные тоже сверяла, у меня там была, что разница была между CRM и не выключил, должна была быть больше, чем в Дискорде. А у меня вышло, что в Дискорде было больше, чем в CRM.С тем автоматом он отнимает 1 час, когда данные сверяют. Да, неважно партнер ты работаешь или нет. У тебя в Дискорде 13 с половиной часов, а в CRM 4,4.Да. Нет, я имею в виду за этот, который были. Оля говорила свои данные.Оля 8,8 вчера. В табличке, которую ты ДТП указала, неправильно. А запоздно вчера? Вчера был, вчера был.А? Вчера был, вчера был, вчера был. А нет, поняли. Вчера был, вчера был.Вот ты. 8,07. В CRM 7,13.Поэтому он в среднем тебе посчитал... 8,08 стоит время. По CRM. За вчера? CRM, вы видите, на 8,08.За понедельник. Должно быть 8,08 часов. Не знаю, Олечка, это ж ты мне отдаешь по АПЕ.Я ж это не сам ручками рисую. Вы считаете неверно. Мы их не считаем, мы их записываем просто.То, что ты передаешь, мы просто сюда записываем. CRM там я вам даю промежутки. 7,13 вычитали вы.Ну дай число тогда. Тогда считай у себя на стороне, отдавай число. А еще вопросик получается.Если у нас система, график разнообразный, да? И я понимаю, там была такая штука, что в дискорд ввели для того, чтобы отслеживать время. Типа, чтобы оно было... И в CRM. В CRM, например, на 15 часов, да? А в дискорде, например, человек работал 8 часов, да, например.То какой смысл тогда... Мы заменяем область CRM в дискорд. Какой смысл тогда выводить по двум данным? Потому что не в любом случае будут у ребят, у кого нет электричества, показывать разные данные. Потому что никто-то не отключил электричество, а кто-то... Для этого два источника мы используем.То есть если хоть один по какому-то параметру есть, то нормально, да? Ну то мы уже как-то... Ну как, есть дискорд, а человека нет. В дискорде о чем нам говорить? Вообще, например, на проектах у меня есть девочка, она в проекте работает. Или как? Из-за того, что мы только что это сделали, то есть это мы пробуем, это мы пытаемся анализировать данные и так далее.То пока проектные, они чуть-чуть за бортом. Да, можно тогда сделать статистику чисто по нашей компании просто. Да, да, по Evaluable и Work.Распределить ставки, да, чисто так, да. Это буквально достижение этой недели. Мы смогли получать данные.Можно монетизировать. Да, принято, будем совершенствоваться. Может и вообще надо пока на данный момент убрать этих проектщиков? Чтобы не путаться тоже.Ну они потом эти данные-то будут заходить вот сюда. Ну делать я не знаю как лучше, я просто уточняю, да. Тут отдельно просто будет партнер с проектами, да, и все.Да, поэтому как бы так. Хорошо, спасибо Колин. Хочешь инпуты со своей стороны, сказать пару слов? Еще раз могу повторить.Мы уже два раза разговаривали. Ну ладно. Описывайте, логируйте, пишите отчеты.И делайте решение. И делайте решение. Хорошо, давайте еще по два слова.Каждый, кто хочет что-то пожаловаться или что-то сказать. Кто там еще не говорил? Лиля, Женя, Оля, Свет, Виля, Влад. Ну в принципе все понятно, будем улучшаться.Я прогнала только что по делу вот этот промпт. И плюс-минус понимаю, что промпт этот не точный, потому что, я так понимаю, репорт не сильно точно введен. Там надо намного детальнее все расписывать, ввести.Ну и в принципе все. Да, мы согласны с тобой. Мы очень много времени не писали, поэтому нужно совершенствовать.Я свои записи тоже совершенствую. Рекомендую. Я когда-то скидывал маркап, когда записываете.Два хэштега добавил, оно становится синим, потом пробел. Квадратные скобки, треугольные скобки, звездочки, черточки и так далее. Помимо висперфлоу, ручками записываете или анализируете даже висперфлоу.Выделяете главные какие-то вещи. Помечаете, пишете проект, задание, двоеточие, источник, ссылка и так далее. Пополняйте, пожалуйста, свои записи.Мы действительно уже школу закончили, 11 лет образования. Вы в бывшей образовании и так далее. Я уверен, что вы сможете.Более детально. Спасибо за инкуджение. Больше деталей, это очень важно.Оля. Я? Да. Записывать все свои данные, все, что делаем, планы развивать на задачи.Ну, может, ты с чем-то не согласен. Согласна. Видишь, что еще какие-то дополнительные нюансы, которые можно было бы улучшить.Что не хватает. То мы сосредоточились. Дели может быть пустой.Не каждый день с кем-то разговоры или что-то делаешь. Бывает пустой. Перенести задачи с предыдущего дня, что не доделано, можно.То, что переезжают файлы постоянно с одного места на другое. Ты у тебя открытый от готового проекта, открываешь на следующий день, раз, половина уже файлов где-то переехала. Ты начинаешь их искать.А ты скажи мне, спроси у меня. Да, мы сейчас модифицируем. Ну, спроси у меня, Коль.Где-то ты есть или на звонках, не всегда есть возможность спросить. Ну, а, например, ты каждый день работаешь в искусственном интеллекте? Да. Ага.Ну, попроси его залогировать. Не обязательно в файле Deli или Plans или так далее. Еще один файл создать.Любой, с любым названием. Ну, чтобы в папочке что-то было. Не, ну, понятно.Это создаётся. Да, поэтому я имею в виду пустую папку. Мне не нужно именно транскрибация созвона.Рудками, в конце концов, я собираюсь что-то генерировать. У меня есть какой-то план. Ты же первичный промпт вбиваешь в искусственный интеллект.Ты ему говоришь, сделай мне то-то, то-то. Пойди, возьми контекст из этой ссылки. Сделай так.Копируй свой промпт, который ты вбил, и закинь в свой Deli. Да, просто у меня бывают даже промпты. Большая часть дня мы сидим, объясняем разработчикам, что нужно сделать.Там Лиля, я. Свои задачи ты теряешься. А промпты бывают даже, ты пишешь в искусственный интеллект, это не всегда какой-то огромный большой промпт. Там бывает даже промпт, просто исправь там модальное окно, выведи дополнительные данные, которые появились.Всё. Копируй и поставь. Копируй и поставь в свой Deli.Или попроси его в настройках, скажи ему каждый за промпт, который я вбиваю, сохраняй, не лагируй. Ещё один способ, если это что-то более глобальное, чем убери мне запятую, то ты можешь его сначала сказать, напиши, создай мне промпт, этот промпт сохрани мне в папке сегодняшнего дня. Как бы ты это сделал? Он тебя расписывает, и вот он для тебя создал, и у тебя есть документация.Я его прошу, создай мне промпт для мультифазового выполнения задачи, каждую фазу разбей на отдельный файл, чтобы если у меня прервётся чат, я мог продолжить в другом, или параллельно в другом выполнять другие этапы. Но это прям очень-очень нужно для нашей синхронизации, иначе не хватит никакого количества часов для вечных созвонок. Тем более, что на созвонках ты не можешь точно сконцентрироваться, подсесть, подумать в тишине, распланировать, расписать, более детально пересмотреть и так далее.Половина не запомнится из звонка. Спасибо, Оль. Свят.Оно услышно? Да. Значит, я на протяжении дня записываю практически всё, о чём мы разговариваем. Вчерашнее замечание по поводу того, что есть электричество или нет электричества, не знаю, как там алгоритм работы это выделил, но дело в том, что я записываю всё, о чём мы разговариваем практически, и оно должно как раз эти разговоры как-то описывать, расставлять, делать планы и всё остальное.Поэтому... Перепроверю, понял. Перепроверим. Я просто разговоры записываю наиболее... Ну, больше всех, наверное.Потому что я включаю запись звука, например, и минут 30-40-50 я могу это записывать. Какие-то ненужные кусочки выбросил. А как уже оно? Можно скрипировать? А по поводу работы... Моя работа практически свелась к тому, что я заполняю таблички, папочки работников.Кто добавляет, то убираю у себя в табличке, потому что люди очень часто увольняются. Просьба к ИЧам как-то сообщать об этом, потому что сегодня целая куча людей поуходила, а мы об этом не знаем. А потом выясняется, что это не так.Дело в том, что некоторых людей увольняют, мы сами об этом не знаем. Ну, как-то это... Не знаю, как этот момент автоматизировать, где-то что-то... У нас вообще есть проблемы со списками сотрудников, как сегодня Коля показывал. Он мне пишет, кто такая Мария.Я сижу, думаю, кто она такая вообще, это Мария? И начали вспоминать, кто такая Илья. Знаем, что такое, нет. Потом думали, может, это Ильницкая, потому что она на пресейле находится, поэтому ее туда занесло в список.Ее занесло, потому что у нее статус в сферам КВЛ стоит, а не в пресейле. Потому что список работников — это такой разговор, в котором постоянно находятся какие-то люди или потом они куда-то пропадают. А потом они вдруг опять появляются.Это очень сложный момент.
