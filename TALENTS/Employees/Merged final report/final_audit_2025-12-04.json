I worked on the business card: I tried to find the files, but I could only find a PDF format, which, unfortunately, could not be edited at all. I redrew some elements from scratch in Photoshop, set the necessary dimensions for the business card, and then prepared the files for print in Photoshop.Next I merged the front and back sides of the business card into one PDF file. I started working on the next task, which is creating a short video for the Brand: I needed to somehow extract the Brand's old and new logos from Canva. After successfully extracting the necessary logos from Canva, I removed their backgrounds.My plans for tomorrow's tasks are: to prepare the required colored backgrounds, which I will layer the logos onto, and then edit and assemble everything in the video editing program.","Discord ID":"378622211465936897","Employee ID":"626"},{"Date":"2025-12-04","Verdict":"⚠️ NO REPORT","Issue":"Daily report missing or too short","Employee Name":"Iuliia K","Department":"Designers","Profession":"Graphic Designer","Current Status":"Work","Rate":1,"Target":"4.0","CRM Time":"7.17","Discord Time":"13.40","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Report":"","Discord ID":"997499428682334278","Employee ID":"228"},{"Date":"2025-12-04","Verdict":"✅ WORK","Issue":"","Employee Name":"Liliia D","Department":"Developers","Profession":"Front End Developer","Current Status":"Work","Rate":1,"Target":"8.0","CRM Time":"8.17","Discord Time":"8.67","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Report":"# Краткий репорт - 04.12.2025**Сотрудник:** Danylenko Liliia (EMP-72754)---## ????

Gateway routes adding /api prefix, AUTH service also adding /api3. followRedirects enabled in proxy, preventing browser redirects**Solutions Implemented**:**Backend Token Validation**:- Added API_GATEWAY_URL to .env- Set correct gateway endpoint: http://localhost:4000/api- Backend now validates tokens correctly**OAuth Flow**:- Fixed double /api in URL construction- Added followRedirects: false to gateway routes- Redirects now reach browser correctly**API Request Flow**:- Requests go to http://localhost:1491- Authorization header with Bearer token- Backend validates via gateway on port 4000**Result**: ✅ Complete authentication flow working**Impact**: Critical - Blocks all authenticated API calls---### 3. Port Management &amp; Process Cleanup**Problem**:- Port 1489 in use by hanging node.exe process- Multiple services competing for ports- No clear port assignment strategy**Investigation Time**: 20 minutes**Solution Implemented**:```bash# Identified hanging processnetstat -ano | findstr :1489# Killed processtaskkill /PID &lt;pid&gt; /F# Assigned new portAPP_PORT=1491```**Port Assignments**:- Backend: 1491 (upload_crms)- Gateway: 4000- Auth: 4000/auth- Frontend: (Vite default)**Result**: ✅ No port conflicts, clean process state**Impact**: Medium - Prevents service startup failures---### 4. UI-kit Integration ⭐ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH****Problem**:- Need shared component library across all microservices- UI-kit exists in Bitbucket but installation failing- Dependency conflicts preventing package build**Investigation Time**: 3.5 hours**Issues Discovered**:**Package Installation Failure**:```bashnpm install git+https://bitbucket.org/ddevdev/ui-kit.git#dev# FAILED: Module not found: react-icons# FAILED: Peer dependency conflict React ^18.0.0```**Root Causes in ui-kit**:1. **Missing dependency**: `react-icons` not in package.json2. **Peer deps too strict**: Only React ^18, but project uses React 193. **Build config issues**: React not externalized4. **dist folder unused**: Present in repo but npm doesn't use it during install**Workaround Implemented**:**Step 1**: Local clone and fixes```bashgit clone &lt;ui-kit-repo&gt;cd ui-kit# Add react-icons to dependencies# Update peerDependencies to \"react\": \"^18 || ^19\"npm installnpm run build```**Step 2**: Local installation```bashcd upload_crms/clientnpm install ../ui-kit --legacy-peer-deps```**Step 3**: Integration in MediaLibrary```javascript// client/src/main.jsximport '@anyemp/ui-kit/styles' // line 6// client/src/components/MediaLibrary.jsximport { Button } from '@anyemp/ui-kit';// Replaced header buttons&lt;Button variant=\"primary\" onClick={handleUpload}&gt;&nbsp; Upload&lt;/Button&gt;```**Result**: ✅ **UI-kit components rendering successfully!****Impact**: **VERY HIGH** - This is the foundation for:- Standardized UI across all microservices- Faster development (reusable components)- Consistent UX- Easier maintenance- Better team collaboration---### 5. Git State Management**Problem**:- Local config changes mixed with shared code- Risk of committing local ports/credentials- vite.config.js and package-lock.json modified locally**Investigation Time**: 30 minutes**Strategy Implemented**:**Files NOT to commit** (local only):- `upload_crms/.env` - local ports, DB credentials- `client/.env.local` - local service URLs- `node_modules/` - dependency installs**Files reverted to branch state**:- `vite.config.js` - proxy settings kept at default- `package-lock.json` - avoid merge conflicts- `api-gateway/` routes - only added followRedirects fix**Files OK to commit** (if needed):- UI-kit integration code (main.jsx, MediaLibrary.jsx)- api-gateway route fixes (followRedirects)**Verification**:```bashgit status# Clean: no unintended changes staged```**Result**: ✅ Local environment configured, git state clean**Impact**: High - Prevents conflicts, maintains team workflow---## ???? Configuration Files Created### 1. Backend .env (upload_crms/.env)```envDB_HOST=127.0.1.27DB_PORT=3306DB_USER=adminDB_PASSWORD=adminDB_NAME=upload-devAPP_PORT=1491NODE_ENV=developmentAPI_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:4000/api```**Purpose**: Local backend configuration**Git Status**: .gitignore (not committed)---### 2.
