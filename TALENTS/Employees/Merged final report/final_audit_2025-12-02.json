I successfully reorganized the DEC_25 folder structure from a Talents-based system to a Department-based system, affecting all 20+ employees. The new structure organizes files by department (AI, Design, Dev, Video, HR, Sales, Lead Generation, Finance), then by employee, then by week and day - this makes file navigation much simpler for the entire team. In addition to the folder migration, I established the WISPR FLOW tracking system, which is a standardized methodology for employees to document their daily work. This system includes templates and guides for tracking tasks, time spent, effort levels, and blockers. The system consists of 7 comprehensive documents (templates, guides, quick references) totaling over 1000 lines of documentation. Two team members (Dana Bindiak from Lead Generation and Svyatoslav Podolsky from Video) have already been trained on this new system and can help other team members get started. I also updated and tested the n8n automation that tracks late employees. The automation compares Discord voice login times with CRM check-in times, runs every 4 hours starting at 11 AM, and automatically outputs results to Google Sheets. The system correctly identifies employees who are \"ok\" (logged in by 9:15 AM), \"late\" (logged in between 9:16 and 11:00 AM), or \"absent\" (not logged in by 11:00 AM), and automatically excludes Days Off from tracking. I audited all Claude AI and Gmail accounts and purchased one new Claude Pro account (remotemployees@gmail.com). This purchase was documented in three locations: the A.I. files, Accesses_25, and Expenses. However, I identified a critical blocker: the team currently has only 3-4 verified Claude accounts for 20+ employees, and we need to purchase 10-15 more accounts immediately (cost approximately $300) to allow the team to work efficiently. I also found and fixed several employee folder location errors (Polina Bagun from Design and Dmitry Marinenko from Dev had work stored in the wrong locations), and I created the missing Sales department folder structure. During this work, I created comprehensive documentation files: a daily notes file (nts.md - 215 lines), a rules and context document (rdm.md - 202 lines), and a task list with 22 identified work items (todo.md - 261 lines). All of these files are stored in English in the employee's Week_01/02/Notes folder. Total time invested: approximately 11 productive hours. Major tasks completed: folder structure migration (4.5 hours), employee folder setup (2.5 hours), automation configuration (1 hour), team training (1.5 hours), account management (2 hours). Work remaining: complete exchange rate entries (30 minutes), purchase additional Claude accounts (critical priority), fix folder location error, and populate missing employee folders. The system is now operational but requires immediate action on the Claude account purchase to avoid team productivity bottlenecks. All work is documented and ready for review.","Discord ID":"934019087946899476","Employee ID":"45810"},{"Date":"2025-12-02","Verdict":"✅ OK","Issue":"","Employee Name":"Cynthia A","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Current Status":"Available","Rate":1,"Target":"8.0","CRM Time":"8.50","Discord Time":"8.55","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Report":"End of Work Day Report – 2nd December 2025Completed Tasks\n\nStarted the day by reviewing all 9 working accounts to identify new accepted connection requests and leads due for follow-up.\n\n\nFound 5 newly connected leads and sent first messages to each, totaling 5 first messages.\n\n\nReviewed the task account for new accepted connections but found none.\n\nFirst Half of the Day – Job Site Spreadsheets (United Kingdom)\n\nWorked on the UK job site assignment and created 16 new company cards in the CRM.\n\n\nSent 26 connection requests to leads attached to the companies added.\n\n\nAbout 1 hour and 40 minutes before break, received instructions from Dana to switch focus to the new job site spreadsheet task.\n\n\nSpent the rest of the first half working with the new spreadsheet, where:\n\n\nProcessed 12 companies.\n\n\nUpdated existing entries with accurate information as needed.\n\n\n\nClient Meeting&nbsp;\n\nNotified by Anastasia (Sales) of a scheduled meeting with a lead.\n\n\nAttended the meeting at 2:00 PM Kyiv time, but the lead did not show up.\n\n\nLeft the meeting at 2:12 PM after waiting for the lead.\n\nSecond Half of the Day – Re-Engagement Activities\n\nSpent the remainder of the workday sending re-engagement messages to old leads.\n\n\nSent a total of 114 re-engagement messages.\n\n\nNo challenges encountered during outreach.\n\nTools Used\n\nLinkedIn, RE Extension, SalesQL, Discord, ChatGPT, Google Docs, Google Sheets.\n\nInsights\n\nEffectively balanced tasks between UK job site processing and the new spreadsheet task assigned by Dana.\n\n\nMaintained consistent CRM updates and outreach performance.\n\n\nDemonstrated reliability by attending the scheduled client meeting despite the no-show.\n\nPlans for Tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue processing the new job site spreadsheet assignment with Dana.\n\nReview accounts for new first messages or follow-up messages.\n\n\nContinue re-engagement outreach and complete any tasks assigned throughout the day.","Discord ID":"1430521213490298930","Employee ID":"87511"},{"Date":"2025-12-02","Verdict":"📦 PROJECT","Issue":"External Project","Employee Name":"Mariia H","Department":"Designers","Profession":"Illustrator","Current Status":"Project","Rate":1,"Target":"8.0","CRM Time":"8.10","Discord Time":"6.05","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Report":"02.12.2025Mariia HlushkoIllustrator1️⃣ Completed Tasks10:00 — Quick call with the client to confirm alignment on current priorities.Розробляю іконки для додатку в Figma, шукаю референси в PinterestДодала декілька варіантів патернуПеревела одну із ілюстрацій в вектор2️⃣ Challenges &amp; Solutions15:00–18:00 — Power outage; relocated and continued working using backup power.3️⃣ Tools &amp; Software Used4️⃣ Plans for TomorrowЗустрітися з клієнтом для огляду робіт і обговорення правокПродовжити переводити ілюстрації в векторЗробити варіації патерну в кольоріДоповнити набір іконок","Discord ID":"660069181328457728","Employee ID":"88626"},{"Date":"2025-12-02","Verdict":"✅ OK","Issue":"","Employee Name":"Dmitriy M","Department":"Developers","Profession":"Full Stack Developer","Current Status":"Available","Rate":1,"Target":"8.0","CRM Time":"8.38","Discord Time":"8.22","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Report":"# Daily Log -

Team Lead Participation in Client Calls- **Context**: Regarding interviews that were scheduled for recruiting (general confusion about scheduling)- **Issue**: Unexpected client appeared yesterday evening, call scheduled for this morning - no candidates available- **Solution Discussed**: Team Lead should join emergency client calls to:&nbsp; - Demonstrate company professionalism&nbsp; - Present company methodologies&nbsp; - Explain that hired candidates will receive training/onboarding support&nbsp; - Offer first days free for full onboarding- **Clarification**: This is NOT for every call, only emergency situations where:&nbsp; - Client appeared last minute (yesterday → today)&nbsp; - No candidates available&nbsp; - Need to preserve client relationship&nbsp; - Team Lead can best represent the department#### 2. Recruiting Department Situation- **Current State**: &nbsp; - Only 2 people in recruiting department&nbsp; - Anastasia just completed recruiting training&nbsp; - Cannot spare resources for projects (part-time or quarter-time)&nbsp; - Department has unlimited tasks- **Decision**: Cannot assign Anastasia to projects at this time - department needs all hands#### 3. Training System vs. Hiring External Recruiters- **New Approach**: Instead of hiring external recruiters, create a system to train any manager with English- **System Components Needed**:&nbsp; - Message templates&nbsp; - Lists (candidate pools)&nbsp; - Follow-ups&nbsp; - Recruiting stages/processes- **Concept**: Universal specialist pipeline (funnel approach)&nbsp; - Wide entry gates - accept as many candidates as possible&nbsp; - Advertise professions that get most responses&nbsp; - Filter during general onboarding based on skills&nbsp; - Route to appropriate departments after assessment#### 4.
