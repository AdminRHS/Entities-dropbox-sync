&nbsp;- **Technical Details**:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Timestamp binding needed for incremental updates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Avoid reprocessing already processed videos&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- For now: just display instructions on the frontend&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Verify if the script works and how it populates CSV&nbsp; &nbsp;**Step 2: Video Queue**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Table with queue of videos for processing&nbsp; &nbsp;- People can select videos from the queue for work&nbsp; &nbsp;- After processing, video is removed from the queue&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Technical Details**:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Database (Postgres) needed to store the queue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- There is a ready HTML prototype - can be used as reference&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Synchronization: first connect to files locally&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Dropbox API - too time-consuming, use local for now&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Consider vector databases for AI work&nbsp; &nbsp;**Step 3: Transcription &amp; Taxonomy**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Most complex and extensive stage&nbsp; &nbsp;- Three main components:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) File information (metadata)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) Video transcription (via Google Studio)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c) **Taxonomy** - most important:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Synchronization with system entities (libraries, actions, objects)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Connections with departments, professions&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Integration with Task Manager&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Correct IDs and paths to entities&nbsp; &nbsp;- Transcription file structure is constantly changing (still being worked on)3. **Prompts System**:&nbsp; &nbsp;- Ready prompts exist for each step&nbsp; &nbsp;- Add a button on the frontend to display prompts&nbsp; &nbsp;- Ability to copy prompts&nbsp; &nbsp;- Show prompts relevant to the current step4. **Technical Implementation**:&nbsp; &nbsp;- **UI Structure**: Tabs for switching between steps&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Flexibility**: Ability to go to any step (not necessarily in order)&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Instructions**: Add MD files with instructions for each step&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Context**: Videos are not just collected - they are integrated into the context of the entire system5. **Future Automation**:&nbsp; &nbsp;- For now: manual workflow with clear instructions&nbsp; &nbsp;- In the future: buttons automatically run scripts&nbsp; &nbsp;- For now: set up basic step-by-step system&nbsp; &nbsp;- Then automate each step separately**Outcomes**:- Defined three-step workflow structure- Identified technical requirements for each step- Established priority: local file connection first, Dropbox API later- Determined need for database (Postgres) and potential vector DBs- Clarified that transcription structure is still evolving---### Development Work: Basic Application Setup**Time**: 16:30 - 18:00**What I worked on**:- Created basic application structure- Set up foundation for further logic implementation- Established base framework that will serve as the foundation for adding functionality**Outcomes**:- Basic application created and ready for logic implementation- Foundation established for building upon- Ready to add workflow logic and features incrementally---## Whisper Flow Transcripts### Meeting Transcript: Frontend Application Planning &amp; File Structure Review**Time**: 10:00 - 11:00**Date**: 27.11.2025**Transcript**:Discussion focused on creating a preliminary plan for implementing a small application with basic formats. The team reviewed how to structure files so they can be used on the frontend and determined how files should be displayed. There was a need to complete a new study of files from a different perspective - from the frontend application development side. The discussion included analyzing how this can be implemented in frontend applications and reviewing the possibilities of applying existing scripts. Key outcomes included identifying the need to restructure files for frontend compatibility, determining the approach for displaying files in the application, analyzing existing scripts and their potential application, and establishing a foundation for frontend implementation planning.---### Meeting Transcript: Video Processing Flow System Overview**Time**: 14:30 - 16:00**Date**: 27.11.2025**Transcript**:The main goal discussed was creating a step-by-step dashboard for video content processing - a system for new employees or those returning to the process, with a clear workflow from video collection to taxonomy.The system consists of three main steps/tabs:**Step 1: SearchQ (Search Queue)** - Instructions on how to run scripts for video collection. Scripts traverse Dropbox folders (MPOI and Daily) and collect information about videos and other content. The result is a CSV file populated with a list of videos. Technical details include: timestamp binding needed for incremental updates, avoiding reprocessing already processed videos, for now just displaying instructions on the frontend, and verifying if the script works and how it populates CSV.**Step 2: Video Queue** - A table with a queue of videos for processing. People can select videos from the queue for work, and after processing, the video is removed from the queue. Technical details: Database (Postgres) needed to store the queue, there is a ready HTML prototype that can be used as reference, synchronization should first connect to files locally, Dropbox API is too time-consuming so use local for now, and consider vector databases for AI work.**Step 3: Transcription &amp; Taxonomy** - The most complex and extensive stage with three main components: a) File information (metadata), b) Video transcription (via Google Studio), c) Taxonomy - the most important part involving synchronization with system entities (libraries, actions, objects), connections with departments and professions, integration with Task Manager, and correct IDs and paths to entities. The transcription file structure is constantly changing and still being worked on.**Prompts System**: Ready prompts exist for each step. Need to add a button on the frontend to display prompts, ability to copy prompts, and show prompts relevant to the current step.**Technical Implementation**: UI structure with tabs for switching between steps, flexibility to go to any step (not necessarily in order), add MD files with instructions for each step, and context that videos are not just collected but integrated into the context of the entire system.**Future Automation**: For now, manual workflow with clear instructions. In the future, buttons will automatically run scripts. For now, set up basic step-by-step system, then automate each step separately.---## Tasks- [x] Create basic application structure (foundation for further logic implementation)- [ ] Analyze file structure in Researches folder- [ ] Create prototype with three tabs (SearchQ, Video Queue, Transcription)- [ ] Implement Tab 1 (SearchQ): instructions + script information- [ ] Implement Tab 2 (Video Queue): video table (use ready HTML)- [ ] Connect to files locally (without Dropbox API for now)- [ ] Add MD files with instructions for each step- [ ] Add prompt display system (button + copying)- [ ] Implement Tab 3 (Transcription): most complex - file + transcription + taxonomy- [ ] Review database options (Postgres, vector databases)- [ ] Review and restructure files for frontend compatibility- [ ] Analyze existing scripts and their application possibilities## Notes- There is a ready HTML prototype for Video Queue - use as reference- Transcription structure is still changing - be prepared for changes- Priority: local file connection, Dropbox API - later- Most complex step - taxonomy synchronization (entities, connections, IDs)- Users can skip steps (don't always go in order)- Files need to be restructured for frontend use- Existing scripts need to be analyzed for frontend application## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcripts","Discord ID":"483232908165775362","Employee ID":"89270"},{"Date":"2025-11-27","Verdict":"⚠️ NO REPORT","Issue":"Daily report is missing or too short","Employee Name":"Anastasiia Pa","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Recruiter","Current Status":"Work","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Discord Time":"9.62","CRM Time":"0.00","Discord Minutes":577,"CRM Status":"Active","First Check-in":"2025-11-27 06:59:20","Last Check-out":"-","Report":"","Discord ID":"1419711736193220661","Employee ID":"88105"},{"Date":"2025-11-27","Verdict":"📦 PROJECT","Issue":"External Project","Employee Name":"Vasyl H","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Current Status":"Project","Leave":"No","Leave Rate":"-","Discord Time":"11.63","CRM Time":"8.50","Discord Minutes":698,"CRM Status":"Active","First Check-in":"2025-11-27 06:58:31","Last Check-out":"2025-11-27 16:28:22","Report":"Today, I focused on posting articles and managing LinkedIn activity.
