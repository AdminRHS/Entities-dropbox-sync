This silences the runtime ReferenceError and restores the anomaly alert rendering flow.- Corrected the number formatter setup in app/formatters.js by explicitly passing maximumFractionDigits: maxFractionDigits to Intl.NumberFormat, eliminating the ReferenceError.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Investigating ReferenceError: MS_PER_DAY is not defined in renderers.js- Found that renderAnomalyAlerts function was trying to use MS_PER_DAY constant that wasn't defined at module level- Added MS_PER_DAY constant definition alongside other renderer constants- Fixed number formatter error where maximumFractionDigits parameter wasn't being passed correctly to Intl.NumberFormat constructor- Testing fixes to ensure anomaly alerts render correctly**Outcomes:**- MS_PER_DAY constant now properly defined, eliminating ReferenceError in renderAnomalyAlerts- Number formatter now correctly configured with maximumFractionDigits parameter- Anomaly alert rendering flow restored and working correctly- Dashboard no longer throws runtime errors when loading anomaly alerts### [10:25-10:39] - [Continue to analyze the Antigravity app]**What I worked on:**- Testing on a project how the app works - Analyzing benefits- Comparing with Cursor**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- better interface- faster process - can`t see old code, only the new one- Testing Antigravity on actual project codebase- Evaluating workflow efficiency and user experience- Comparing features, speed, and interface design with Cursor IDE- Analyzing pros and cons of each tool**Outcomes:**- Antigravity has more polished and intuitive interface- Faster code generation and response times observed- Different approach to code display - shows only new code, not old context- Both tools have their strengths - Antigravity for speed/interface, Cursor for context visibility- Need to evaluate which tool fits better for different types of tasks### [10:40-12:00] - [More fixing in lead_gen_analytics]**What I worked on:**- Augmented update_data.py to add both the script directory and its parent to sys.path before importing reports.generate_snapshot. This handles both local and CI layouts, ensuring the reports package is always discoverable and removing the ModuleNotFoundError.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Investigating ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reports' in update_data.py- Found that the script was failing in CI environment due to different directory structure- Added sys.path manipulation to include both script directory and parent directory- This ensures reports package can be found in both local development and CI environments- Testing import resolution in both environments**Outcomes:**- update_data.py now works correctly in both local and CI environments- ModuleNotFoundError resolved by adding proper path resolution- Script can now find reports.generate_snapshot module regardless of execution context- CI pipeline no longer fails due to import errors### [13:00-14:07] - [fixing problems with login in upload_crms]**What I worked on:**- The frontend is now sending the `service` parameter, but the 500 is still coming from `https://userdev.anyemp.com/api/auth/google/callback`. That endpoint lives on your shared Auth service, so the failure is happening there—our app doesn't control the code that handles the callback.Why it still returns 500:- The request succeeds at Google (you get a `code`), then the API Gateway proxies the callback to the Auth service. A 500 means the Auth service hit an internal error while exchanging the code or processing the redirect.- Common causes:&nbsp; - The Auth service doesn't have `http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback` registered as an allowed redirect URI.&nbsp; - The Auth service still expects additional parameters besides `redirect_uri` (for example `state` or `client_id`) that aren't being provided.&nbsp; - The gateway/Auth service configuration for the `upload_crms` service is missing (e.g., no matching service entry or client credentials).What you can do:1. Grab the Auth service logs around the time of the request (or ask whoever manages it) to see the exact stack trace; that will tell you what failed (invalid redirect URI, missing service, etc.).2. Confirm with the Auth-service maintainers which query params are required for their `/api/auth/google` endpoint and what the expected redirect URI should be.3. Once you know the server-side requirement, adjust the client request accordingly (or update the Auth service configuration) and retry.Since the error occurs inside `userdev.anyemp.com`, we can't patch this repo to fix it—we need the backend's error details to know why it refuses the callback.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Investigating Google OAuth callback 500 error in upload_crms- Added service parameter to Google OAuth login request in auth.js- Updated loginWithGoogle to include SERVICE_NAME from config- Modified useAuth and OAuthCallback to use SERVICE_NAME from config instead of hardcoded 'upload_crms'- Error persists because it's happening on the Auth service backend (userdev.anyemp.com)- The frontend changes are correct, but backend configuration needs to be updated- Need to coordinate with Auth service maintainers to fix redirect URI registration**Outcomes:**- Frontend now properly sends service parameter in Google OAuth requests- Code centralized to use SERVICE_NAME from config.js instead of hardcoded values- Identified that the 500 error is a backend configuration issue, not a frontend bug- Frontend implementation is correct - waiting on backend team to configure redirect URIs- All changes documented in prompt-cursor-skichko.md### [14:07-14:40] - [learning ssh]**What I worked on:**- Generating a SSH key- Added to GitHub- Set up SSH connection **Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Learning SSH key generation process using ssh-keygen- Generating RSA key pair for GitHub authentication- Adding public key to GitHub account settings- Testing SSH connection to GitHub repositories- Understanding SSH key management and security best practices**Outcomes:**- Successfully generated SSH key pair (private and public keys)- Public key added to GitHub account for authentication- SSH connection to GitHub working correctly- Can now clone and push to repositories using SSH instead of HTTPS- Improved security and workflow efficiency with SSH authentication### [14:41-16:16] - [Working on Dashboard project]**What I worked on:**- Augmented update_data.py to add both the script directory and its parent to sys.path before importing reports.generate_snapshot. This handles both local and CI layouts, ensuring the reports package is always discoverable and removing the ModuleNotFoundError.- Continued work on fixing import issues and ensuring script works in all environments**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Continuing work on Dashboard project import resolution- Testing update_data.py in different directory structures- Verifying that sys.path modifications work correctly- Ensuring reports module can be imported in both development and CI environments- Testing script execution to confirm ModuleNotFoundError is resolved**Outcomes:**- update_data.py now robustly handles different directory structures- Script works correctly in both local development and CI environments- ModuleNotFoundError completely resolved through proper path resolution- Dashboard data update process now reliable across all environments### [16:17-17:00] - [Working on lead_gen_project]**What I worked on:**- Fixed `MS_PER_DAY is not defined` in `renderers.js` by defining the constant at the module level so `renderAnomalyAlerts` can compute date window sizes.- Fixed `maximumFractionDigits is not defined` in `formatters.js` by correcting the `Intl.NumberFormat` options to use the parameter name correctly.- Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reports'` in `update_data.py` by adding a fallback import that dynamically loads `generate_daily_report` from `../reports/generate_snapshot.py` when the package import fails, with graceful error handling to skip snapshot generation if the module is unavailable.- Added hover effects for all tables (`.summary-table`, `.matrix-table`, `.segmentation-table`) with border highlighting using `outline`, background color changes, cell border highlighting, and box-shadow for depth, with separate styling for light and dark themes.- Added hover effects for chart cards (`.chart-card`) with animated border highlighting, elevated shadow, and subtle transform on hover, with theme-aware colors for both light and dark modes.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Investigated runtime errors: `MS_PER_DAY` undefined in `renderAnomalyAlerts`, `maximumFractionDigits` undefined in number formatter, and `ModuleNotFoundError` for `reports` module in CI. Fixed by adding missing constant definition, correcting `Intl.NumberFormat` options, and implementing a fallback import mechanism with try/except and dynamic module loading.- Enhanced table interactivity by adding CSS hover states with `outline` borders, background color transitions, cell border highlighting, and shadow effects. Applied to all table types with theme-specific variants.- Enhanced chart card interactivity by adding hover states with animated borders, elevated shadows, and transform effects. Ensured theme compatibility for both light and dark modes.**Outcomes:**- All runtime errors resolved: dashboard loads without `ReferenceError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions.- Improved UX: tables and charts now provide visual feedback on hover with border highlighting and smooth transitions.- Better maintainability: error handling in `update_data.py` allows the script to run even when the `reports` module is unavailable, preventing CI failures.- Consistent theming: hover effects work correctly in both light and dark themes with appropriate color adjustments.- Enhanced interactivity: users can now easily identify interactive elements (tables and charts) through hover feedback, improving the overall dashboard experience.## Notes## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcripts","Short name":"Artem Sk","Department":"Developers","Profession":"Front End Developer","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Available"},{"Employee ID":"37226","Discord User ID":"910144676881903646","Records Count":1,"First Check In":"2025-11-20 07:00:00","Last Check Out":"2025-11-20 16:00:00","Daily Report":"","Short name":"Nikolay A","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Project manager","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Work"},{"Employee ID":"443","Discord User ID":"923207596670849024","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-11-20 06:56:22","Last Check Out":"2025-11-20 16:01:03","Daily Report":"20.11.25Project Spares Nordic - full time&nbsp;I continued to work with the TVC order E25110300186.
