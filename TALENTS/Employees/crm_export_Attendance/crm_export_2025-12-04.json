Executive Summary**Project Status**: ✅ **Major Milestone Achieved - UI-kit Integration Working****Major Achievement**: Successfully configured local development environment without Docker and achieved breakthrough integration of shared UI library across microservices. This enables standardized interface development and sets foundation for rapid component development.**Work Type**: Infrastructure setup, debugging, dependency resolution, integration testing**Time Investment**: 9 hours---## ???? Objectives &amp; Outcomes### Primary Objective**Configure local development environment and integrate shared UI-kit library****Status**: ✅ **Achieved****Evidence**:- Backend running locally on port 1491- MySQL database configured via Open Server- Frontend connecting to all services- UI-kit Button component rendering in MediaLibrary- All authentication flows working- No breaking changes committed to git---## ???? Technical Work Completed### 1. Local Environment Configuration ⭐ **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE****Problem**:- Development required Docker, slowing iteration speed- Database connection hardcoded for docker-compose- Port conflicts with existing services- No local configuration strategy**Investigation Time**: 2 hours**Solution Implemented**:**Backend Configuration** (upload_crms/.env):```envDB_HOST=127.0.1.27DB_USER=adminDB_PASSWORD=adminDB_NAME=upload-devAPP_PORT=1491API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:4000/api```**Frontend Configuration** (client/.env.local):```envVITE_API_URL=http://localhost:1491VITE_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:4000/apiVITE_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4000VITE_SERVICE_NAME=upload_crms```**MySQL Setup**:- Installed via Open Server- Created database: upload-dev- User: admin / admin- Host: 127.0.1.27 (not localhost for network config)**Result**: ✅ All services running locally without Docker**Impact**: High - Enables faster development cycles, easier debugging---### 2. Authentication System Fixes**Problem**:- Token validation failing with 401 errors after login- OAuth redirects not reaching browser (double /api/api)- API requests blocked despite valid tokens**Investigation Time**: 1.5 hours**Root Causes**:1. Backend validating tokens through wrong API_GATEWAY_URL (port 3003 vs 4000)2. Gateway routes adding /api prefix, AUTH service also adding /api3. followRedirects enabled in proxy, preventing browser redirects**Solutions Implemented**:**Backend Token Validation**:- Added API_GATEWAY_URL to .env- Set correct gateway endpoint: http://localhost:4000/api- Backend now validates tokens correctly**OAuth Flow**:- Fixed double /api in URL construction- Added followRedirects: false to gateway routes- Redirects now reach browser correctly**API Request Flow**:- Requests go to http://localhost:1491- Authorization header with Bearer token- Backend validates via gateway on port 4000**Result**: ✅ Complete authentication flow working**Impact**: Critical - Blocks all authenticated API calls---### 3. Port Management &amp; Process Cleanup**Problem**:- Port 1489 in use by hanging node.exe process- Multiple services competing for ports- No clear port assignment strategy**Investigation Time**: 20 minutes**Solution Implemented**:```bash# Identified hanging processnetstat -ano | findstr :1489# Killed processtaskkill /PID &lt;pid&gt; /F# Assigned new portAPP_PORT=1491```**Port Assignments**:- Backend: 1491 (upload_crms)- Gateway: 4000- Auth: 4000/auth- Frontend: (Vite default)**Result**: ✅ No port conflicts, clean process state**Impact**: Medium - Prevents service startup failures---### 4. UI-kit Integration ⭐ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH****Problem**:- Need shared component library across all microservices- UI-kit exists in Bitbucket but installation failing- Dependency conflicts preventing package build**Investigation Time**: 3.5 hours**Issues Discovered**:**Package Installation Failure**:```bashnpm install git+https://bitbucket.org/ddevdev/ui-kit.git#dev# FAILED: Module not found: react-icons# FAILED: Peer dependency conflict React ^18.0.0```**Root Causes in ui-kit**:1. **Missing dependency**: `react-icons` not in package.json2. **Peer deps too strict**: Only React ^18, but project uses React 193. **Build config issues**: React not externalized4. **dist folder unused**: Present in repo but npm doesn't use it during install**Workaround Implemented**:**Step 1**: Local clone and fixes```bashgit clone &lt;ui-kit-repo&gt;cd ui-kit# Add react-icons to dependencies# Update peerDependencies to \"react\": \"^18 || ^19\"npm installnpm run build```**Step 2**: Local installation```bashcd upload_crms/clientnpm install ../ui-kit --legacy-peer-deps```**Step 3**: Integration in MediaLibrary```javascript// client/src/main.jsximport '@anyemp/ui-kit/styles' // line 6// client/src/components/MediaLibrary.jsximport { Button } from '@anyemp/ui-kit';// Replaced header buttons&lt;Button variant=\"primary\" onClick={handleUpload}&gt;&nbsp; Upload&lt;/Button&gt;```**Result**: ✅ **UI-kit components rendering successfully!****Impact**: **VERY HIGH** - This is the foundation for:- Standardized UI across all microservices- Faster development (reusable components)- Consistent UX- Easier maintenance- Better team collaboration---### 5. Git State Management**Problem**:- Local config changes mixed with shared code- Risk of committing local ports/credentials- vite.config.js and package-lock.json modified locally**Investigation Time**: 30 minutes**Strategy Implemented**:**Files NOT to commit** (local only):- `upload_crms/.env` - local ports, DB credentials- `client/.env.local` - local service URLs- `node_modules/` - dependency installs**Files reverted to branch state**:- `vite.config.js` - proxy settings kept at default- `package-lock.json` - avoid merge conflicts- `api-gateway/` routes - only added followRedirects fix**Files OK to commit** (if needed):- UI-kit integration code (main.jsx, MediaLibrary.jsx)- api-gateway route fixes (followRedirects)**Verification**:```bashgit status# Clean: no unintended changes staged```**Result**: ✅ Local environment configured, git state clean**Impact**: High - Prevents conflicts, maintains team workflow---## ???? Configuration Files Created### 1. Backend .env (upload_crms/.env)```envDB_HOST=127.0.1.27DB_PORT=3306DB_USER=adminDB_PASSWORD=adminDB_NAME=upload-devAPP_PORT=1491NODE_ENV=developmentAPI_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:4000/api```**Purpose**: Local backend configuration**Git Status**: .gitignore (not committed)---### 2.
