I successfully reorganized the DEC_25 folder structure from a Talents-based system to a Department-based system, affecting all 20+ employees. The new structure organizes files by department (AI, Design, Dev, Video, HR, Sales, Lead Generation, Finance), then by employee, then by week and day - this makes file navigation much simpler for the entire team. In addition to the folder migration, I established the WISPR FLOW tracking system, which is a standardized methodology for employees to document their daily work. This system includes templates and guides for tracking tasks, time spent, effort levels, and blockers. The system consists of 7 comprehensive documents (templates, guides, quick references) totaling over 1000 lines of documentation. Two team members (Dana Bindiak from Lead Generation and Svyatoslav Podolsky from Video) have already been trained on this new system and can help other team members get started. I also updated and tested the n8n automation that tracks late employees. The automation compares Discord voice login times with CRM check-in times, runs every 4 hours starting at 11 AM, and automatically outputs results to Google Sheets. The system correctly identifies employees who are \"ok\" (logged in by 9:15 AM), \"late\" (logged in between 9:16 and 11:00 AM), or \"absent\" (not logged in by 11:00 AM), and automatically excludes Days Off from tracking. I audited all Claude AI and Gmail accounts and purchased one new Claude Pro account (remotemployees@gmail.com). This purchase was documented in three locations: the A.I. files, Accesses_25, and Expenses. However, I identified a critical blocker: the team currently has only 3-4 verified Claude accounts for 20+ employees, and we need to purchase 10-15 more accounts immediately (cost approximately $300) to allow the team to work efficiently. I also found and fixed several employee folder location errors (Polina Bagun from Design and Dmitry Marinenko from Dev had work stored in the wrong locations), and I created the missing Sales department folder structure. During this work, I created comprehensive documentation files: a daily notes file (nts.md - 215 lines), a rules and context document (rdm.md - 202 lines), and a task list with 22 identified work items (todo.md - 261 lines). All of these files are stored in English in the employee's Week_01/02/Notes folder. Total time invested: approximately 11 productive hours. Major tasks completed: folder structure migration (4.5 hours), employee folder setup (2.5 hours), automation configuration (1 hour), team training (1.5 hours), account management (2 hours). Work remaining: complete exchange rate entries (30 minutes), purchase additional Claude accounts (critical priority), fix folder location error, and populate missing employee folders. The system is now operational but requires immediate action on the Claude account purchase to avoid team productivity bottlenecks. All work is documented and ready for review.","Short name":"Daria Y","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Financial manager","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Work","Rate":1,"CRM time":"9:10"},{"Employee ID":"40270","Discord User ID":"931567810780487711","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-12-02 07:57:21","Last Check Out":"2025-12-02 17:18:07","Daily Report":"02/12&nbsp;генерация изображений в ИИ и загрузка в папку&nbsp;загрузка llm файла на вебсайт&nbsp;creating a form/ poll on the website&nbsp;designing documents for Sponsors - What We Require from you&nbsp;updating dates on A Vida graphics&nbsp;creating slides for 2026 in content calendars - Pennypop, CPSkillnet","Short name":"Anna Z","Department":"Marketers","Profession":"Social Media Manager","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Part Project + Part Project","Rate":1,"CRM time":"8:00"},{"Employee ID":"85829","Discord User ID":"1126539079484457100","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-12-02 06:50:14","Last Check Out":"2025-12-02 18:01:36","Daily Report":"2 december 2025Anush IskandarovaProject Stick ManufakturHad a conversation with client, finished more than the half of the products.

Team Lead Participation in Client Calls- **Context**: Regarding interviews that were scheduled for recruiting (general confusion about scheduling)- **Issue**: Unexpected client appeared yesterday evening, call scheduled for this morning - no candidates available- **Solution Discussed**: Team Lead should join emergency client calls to:&nbsp; - Demonstrate company professionalism&nbsp; - Present company methodologies&nbsp; - Explain that hired candidates will receive training/onboarding support&nbsp; - Offer first days free for full onboarding- **Clarification**: This is NOT for every call, only emergency situations where:&nbsp; - Client appeared last minute (yesterday → today)&nbsp; - No candidates available&nbsp; - Need to preserve client relationship&nbsp; - Team Lead can best represent the department#### 2. Recruiting Department Situation- **Current State**: &nbsp; - Only 2 people in recruiting department&nbsp; - Anastasia just completed recruiting training&nbsp; - Cannot spare resources for projects (part-time or quarter-time)&nbsp; - Department has unlimited tasks- **Decision**: Cannot assign Anastasia to projects at this time - department needs all hands#### 3. Training System vs. Hiring External Recruiters- **New Approach**: Instead of hiring external recruiters, create a system to train any manager with English- **System Components Needed**:&nbsp; - Message templates&nbsp; - Lists (candidate pools)&nbsp; - Follow-ups&nbsp; - Recruiting stages/processes- **Concept**: Universal specialist pipeline (funnel approach)&nbsp; - Wide entry gates - accept as many candidates as possible&nbsp; - Advertise professions that get most responses&nbsp; - Filter during general onboarding based on skills&nbsp; - Route to appropriate departments after assessment#### 4. Onboarding #2 Development (December Task)- **Timeline**: December implementation (4-5 days)- **Structure**: &nbsp; - Each department takes 2 days to create department-specific tasks&nbsp; - Can create detailed tasks for own department&nbsp; - Must provide instructions/rules for other departments- **Requirements**:&nbsp; - Document creation needed&nbsp; - Tasks must have supporting documents with details&nbsp; - Tools must be marked/noted&nbsp; - Personal calls needed: &nbsp; &nbsp; - To show how to do it&nbsp; &nbsp; - To check progress&nbsp; &nbsp; - To verify implementation- **Reason**: New people won't understand from half-words - need full documentation#### 5. Presale Flow Systematization- **Goal**: Establish complete presale system (not just presale as a factor, but entire system)- **Weekly Flow Structure**:&nbsp; - **Wednesday**: Client interviews (always on Wednesdays)&nbsp; - **Thursday**: Know who/what is needed (±)&nbsp; - **Thursday-Sunday**: Build candidate pool (all into one funnel, as many as possible)&nbsp; - **Monday-Tuesday**: Verify and validate candidates will potentially stay on project&nbsp; - **Next Wednesday**: Present candidates to client- **Documentation**: Everything must be documented in Dropbox:&nbsp; - README files&nbsp; - Full ecosystem description&nbsp; - Week-to-week flow tracking&nbsp; - Files, tracking, progress, WhisperFlow, etc.- **Phase 0 (December)**: Training phase&nbsp; - Make as many mistakes as possible&nbsp; - Understand what documents are missing&nbsp; - Write missing documents&nbsp; - Identify what didn't work&nbsp; - Implement rules&nbsp; - Refine process like clockwork#### 6. Final Goals- **Primary Goal**: 100 presales on website by January- **Blocking Factor**: Video interview processing&nbsp; - Try to achieve 1-day turnaround for presale videos to be uploaded to website- **Target**: Meet new season in January with this system in place## Key Decisions Made1. **Team Lead joins emergency client calls** (not all calls, only emergencies)2. **Train managers in recruiting** instead of hiring external recruiters3. **Create universal specialist pipeline** system4. **Develop Onboarding #2** in December (each department creates 2-day tasks)5. **Systematize presale flow** with Wednesday client calls6. **Goal: 100 presales** on website by January## Action Items for Anastasia- [ ] Understand the training system approach for managers- [ ] Prepare to create Onboarding #2 tasks for recruiting department- [ ] Prepare instructions for other departments on how to create their Onboarding #2- [ ] Work on systematizing presale flow documentation- [ ] Support presale flow Phase 0 implementation in December","Short name":"Anastasiia Pa","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Recruiter","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Work","Rate":1,"CRM time":"8:32"},{"Employee ID":"86297","Discord User ID":"1074804978172035223","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-12-02 07:16:45","Last Check Out":"2025-12-02 18:36:10","Daily Report":"Plamena Peneva, BulgariaDate: 02.12.2025New companies: 5Sent request 10Connected 3Old connection messages 60Other:&nbsp;-job sites-project Frank","Short name":"Plamena P","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Part Project + Part Project","Rate":1,"CRM time":"9:53"},{"Employee ID":"86246","Discord User ID":"1381247747650486312","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-12-02 07:00:23","Last Check Out":"2025-12-02 16:08:11","Daily Report":"### **Daily Report****Key Result: The job site production cycle is fully completed, and the Google Maps project has entered the iterative refinement phase based on direct feedback from the team.**Today marked a significant milestone, marking the successful completion of one major project and the beginning of a new, qualitative phase in the development of another.**Key Achievements:**1. **The job site data processing project is fully completed:*** Processing of all remaining companies from the large dataset has been completed.* **The final, fully completed spreadsheet has been uploaded** and transferred to production.
