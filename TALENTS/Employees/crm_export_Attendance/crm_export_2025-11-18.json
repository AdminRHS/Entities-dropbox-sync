Authorization Logic Review]**What I worked on:**- **Client-side cleanup (First Priority):**&nbsp; - Removed unnecessary files and data from `upload_crms/client` directory&nbsp; - Cleaned up unused components and assets&nbsp; - Removed redundant configuration files&nbsp; - Organized client-side code structure- **Authorization Logic Review &amp; Analysis:**&nbsp; - Conducted comprehensive review of authorization logic in `upload_crms` project&nbsp; - Analyzed server-side authentication middleware (`src/middlewares/auth.ts`)&nbsp; - Reviewed client-side authorization components (ProtectedRoute, useAuth hook)&nbsp; - Examined token management and refresh logic&nbsp; - Compared authorization implementation with `talent-service` to ensure consistency&nbsp; - Identified differences in route protection patterns (global vs per-route)**Key Findings:**- Auth middleware was applied globally to all routes (including `/public/uploads`)- Pattern didn't match `talent-service` which uses per-route authentication- `/public/uploads` route was incorrectly protected (should be public for media files)- Auth middleware lacked detailed logging for debugging**Outcomes:**- Cleaner client-side codebase with unnecessary files removed- Complete understanding of current authorization flow- Identified areas needing alignment with `talent-service` pattern- Documented authorization architecture and flow---### [Afternoon] - [Authorization Logic Refactoring]**What I worked on:**- Refactored authentication middleware to match `talent-service` pattern&nbsp; - Renamed `authMiddleware` to `authenticateToken` (named export)&nbsp; - Added comprehensive debug logging (matching talent-service)&nbsp; - Enhanced error handling with detailed error information&nbsp; - Maintained backward compatibility with default export- Updated route protection in `src/app.ts`:&nbsp; - Removed global auth middleware application&nbsp; - Applied `authenticateToken` middleware per route (matching talent-service)&nbsp;

This eliminated drift between markup and code, and let me reference keys via constants everywhere.- Rebuilt the translation layer (`src/lib/i18n.ts`): consolidated all language strings (English, Ukrainian, Russian, German), added helpers (`t`, `translateWithArgs`) for placeholder replacements like `{date}`, and introduced locale-aware formatters (`formatMonthYear`, `formatDateLong`) that all components can reuse instead of hardcoding `toLocaleDateString('en-US', ...)`.- Tagged every UI element—tabs, headers, buttons, table columns, filters, stats—with `data-i18n-key` attributes so the translation module can automatically walk the DOM and update text whenever the language changes. For dynamic renderers (`render-stats`, `renderModals`, etc.), I injected `data-i18n-key` into their template strings so newly inserted HTML also participates in auto-translation.- Normalized button styling (“Give Yellow Card” and similar) so they rely on shared CSS classes, ensuring color changes propagate consistently (e.g., turning all “Give Yellow Card” buttons yellow across dashboard and modals).- Built a centralized language persistence/observer flow: instead of each render function calling `applyTranslations`, the dashboard dispatches a `dashboard:rendered` event after major reflows; the i18n layer listens and re-translates everything in one pass, guaranteeing newly rendered sections (stats, tables, modals) stay localized without extra manual calls.- Added `languageState`: a lightweight module with `setLanguageState`, `getLanguage`, `subscribe`, and a standard `LANGUAGE_EVENT`. `i18n.ts` now syncs its internal language with this state—initializing silently, then emitting whenever the user selects a different language. This gave me a single event source that other modules can subscribe to instead of each component reinventing the wheel.- Hooked the subscription into all JS-generated text flows:&nbsp; - `render-stats.ts` re-renders stats, team grids, yellow/green-card modals, and placeholders whenever the language changes so labels (“Team Size”, “Select an employee…”) update immediately.&nbsp; - `renderGreenCardModals`/`renderModals` now fetch placeholders (“Select a type…”, “Add specific details…”) via `global.t`, ensuring dropdowns and textareas reflect the active language.&nbsp; - `leaderboard.ts` translates badge labels (“New”, “⭐ 5+ cards”), “Never” for missing dates, and the “No employees match …” fallback dynamically, and listens to `LANGUAGE_EVENT` to rerun `renderLeaderboard`.&nbsp; - `modals.ts` uses `translateWithArgs` for strings like “Violations on {date}”, applies locale-formatted dates to each violation/green-card entry, and ensures “No comment”/“No violations…” are localized.&nbsp; - `ui.ts` extracts reusable month-header updates so both yellow-card and green-card calendars show translated month names; it also listens for `LANGUAGE_EVENT` so the header labels update immediately when the language switches, even without user interaction.- Ensured the translation map covers every string previously hard-coded in JS: dropdown placeholders, tooltip warnings, badge text, calendar headings, stats suffixes (“employees”), hints (“(5+ cards)”), and more. This required auditing `render-stats.ts`, `render-modals.ts`, `leaderboard.ts`, and even the modal templates for any English-only text, then moving those strings into the dictionary.- Kept TypeScript happy by extending `global.d.ts` with the new structures: `LanguageState` interface, `languageState` global, expanded `I18nKeyMap` sections (input/modals/badges), and the new export signatures (e.g., `translateWithArgs`, `formatMonthYear`, `formatDateLong`). This prevents future regressions where TS code references a missing key.- Mirrored every TypeScript change into `dist/` by rebuilding the project, ensuring the shipped JS stays in sync and the new modules (`language-state.js`) load before components rely on them.**Whisper Flow Transcript:**[Not provided.]**Outcomes:**- The dashboard now has end-to-end internationalization: static markup and dynamic JS output pull from the same translation map, react instantly to language changes, and format dates in the user’s locale. No hard-coded English remains in user-facing strings.- Language switching is centralized and observable. Components subscribe to `languageState` rather than manually polling `t()`, reducing duplication and future errors.- Dropdowns, modals, badges, and calendars inherit translated placeholders/labels automatically, greatly improving UX for Ukrainian, Russian, and German users.- The groundwork is in place for future locales or lazy-loaded language packs, since both keys and dictionary live in dedicated modules with typed access.- ### [13:06-17:00] - [Working on lead_gen_analytics project]**What I worked on:**- Added 7 new analytical tables for the Lead Generation Dashboard:1. **Daily KPI Snapshot** (Weekly tab) — daily metrics with deltas from the previous day2. **Top Performers by Conversion Step** (Leaderboard tab) — who is strong at which conversion stage3. **Lead Source Quality Breakdown** (Source tab) — analysis of source quality throughout the funnel4. **Time to Conversion** (new Timing tab) — statistics of time between stages (median, average, fastest, slowest, 90th percentile)5. **Team Load / Capacity** (Leaderboard tab) — team load and available capacity6. **Lead Segmentation by Country** (Countries tab) — cross-tab segmentation table by country7. **Lead Timeline Details** (Lead Insight modal window) — detailed drill-down on each lead- Bug fixes and improvements UX:- Removed duplicate `formatDays` function- Fixed logic for calculating time between stages for Timing table- Added vertical separators between segments in segmentation table- Centered segment titles- Fixed syntax errors in `modals.js` (replacing template literals with string concatenation)- Added internationalization:- Translations for all new tables and metrics (en, uk, ru, de)- Localization of dates and number formats**Whisper Flow Transcript:**- Implemented data aggregation functions (`buildDailySnapshots`, `buildStepPerformanceDataset`, `buildSourceQualityDataset`, `buildTimingStats`, `buildTeamLoadCapacity`, `buildCountrySegmentation`, `buildLeadTimelineDetails`)- Added table renderers in `renderers.js` with support for sorting and visuals indicators- New tables integrated into existing caching and state management system- New \"Timing\" tab added and Lead Insight modal window expanded- Statistics calculation optimized (median, percentiles, averages)**Outcomes:**- Dashboard now includes 7 additional analytical tables for deeper analysis- Improved data visualization with vertical dividers and centered headers- Added detailed drill-down for each lead with timeline of stages- Fixed all syntax errors and optimized code- Support for 4 languages ​​for all new features- Ready to use: all tables are automatically updated when filters are changed and integrated into existing caching system---## Notes## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcripts","Short name":"Artem Sk"},{"Employee ID":"37226","Discord User ID":"910144676881903646","Status":"No Records","Records Count":0,"First Check In":"","Last Check Out":"","Daily Report":"","Short name":"Nikolay A"},{"Employee ID":"443","Discord User ID":"923207596670849024","Status":"Active","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-11-18 06:56:26","Last Check Out":"2025-11-18 16:00:13","Daily Report":"18.11.25Project Spares Nordic - full time&nbsp;I`ve finished to work with the TVC order E25093000175.
