Account Sweep &amp; Messaging\nI checked all working accounts for new requests and messages, cleared inboxes, and sent first-message templates. CRM statuses were updated to reflect the newest outreach results. Using Gemini, I generated follow-up messages for leads who accepted connection requests and sent them across all accounts. All outcomes and changes were logged in the CRM to keep pipelines accurate and up to date.2. Onboarding &amp; Training\nI conducted live training sessions for newcomers, walking them through the RE Extension, Google Scrape Extension, and correct usage of Whisper Flow. I explained our messaging templates, timing rules, and how to manage status updates in the CRM and research spreadsheet. We practiced the Old Connections task together to ensure newcomers understand relevance checks and proper cadence.\n\n\n3. Lead Sourcing, Content Tasks &amp; Roster Updates\nI worked through the Google Maps spreadsheet to review companies, create CRM cards for relevant ones, and send new connection requests. After acceptances, I used Gemini to generate personalized follow-up messages. I also created four variations of LinkedIn post copy and coordinated it with the designer’s image for posting. Finally, I updated the employee workflow analysis sheet by removing three released employees and adding three newcomers to keep the roster current.","Short name":"Dana Bi","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Work","Rate":1,"CRM time":"8:11"},{"Employee ID":"87537","Discord User ID":"677608728362483713","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-11-27 07:01:37","Last Check Out":"2025-11-27 16:09:49","Daily Report":"27.11.2025Polina Bogun — UX/UI Designer1️⃣ Completed Tasks\n\nImplemented modal system for employee cards on the HR Dashboard (detailed view now opens in a right-side panel instead of full-screen).\n\n\nDisplayed employee info: CRM hours, Discord hours, reports.\n\n\nPresented dashboard updates during review meeting and aligned requirements with team leads.\n\n\nAdded new tasks and removed outdated ones based on meeting transcript.\n\n\nUnderstood and documented full list of upcoming structural changes (metrics, calendar, employee separation, API update).\n\n\nAttended workflow meeting and learned the updated process for daily documentation (daily.md + plans.md + tasks.md → auto-generated processed file).\n\n2️⃣ Challenges &amp;

File Structure Review**Time**: 10:00 - 11:00**Date**: 27.11.2025**Transcript**:Discussion focused on creating a preliminary plan for implementing a small application with basic formats. The team reviewed how to structure files so they can be used on the frontend and determined how files should be displayed. There was a need to complete a new study of files from a different perspective - from the frontend application development side. The discussion included analyzing how this can be implemented in frontend applications and reviewing the possibilities of applying existing scripts. Key outcomes included identifying the need to restructure files for frontend compatibility, determining the approach for displaying files in the application, analyzing existing scripts and their potential application, and establishing a foundation for frontend implementation planning.---### Meeting Transcript: Video Processing Flow System Overview**Time**: 14:30 - 16:00**Date**: 27.11.2025**Transcript**:The main goal discussed was creating a step-by-step dashboard for video content processing - a system for new employees or those returning to the process, with a clear workflow from video collection to taxonomy.The system consists of three main steps/tabs:**Step 1: SearchQ (Search Queue)** - Instructions on how to run scripts for video collection. Scripts traverse Dropbox folders (MPOI and Daily) and collect information about videos and other content. The result is a CSV file populated with a list of videos. Technical details include: timestamp binding needed for incremental updates, avoiding reprocessing already processed videos, for now just displaying instructions on the frontend, and verifying if the script works and how it populates CSV.**Step 2: Video Queue** - A table with a queue of videos for processing. People can select videos from the queue for work, and after processing, the video is removed from the queue. Technical details: Database (Postgres) needed to store the queue, there is a ready HTML prototype that can be used as reference, synchronization should first connect to files locally, Dropbox API is too time-consuming so use local for now, and consider vector databases for AI work.**Step 3: Transcription &amp; Taxonomy** - The most complex and extensive stage with three main components: a) File information (metadata), b) Video transcription (via Google Studio), c) Taxonomy - the most important part involving synchronization with system entities (libraries, actions, objects), connections with departments and professions, integration with Task Manager, and correct IDs and paths to entities. The transcription file structure is constantly changing and still being worked on.**Prompts System**: Ready prompts exist for each step. Need to add a button on the frontend to display prompts, ability to copy prompts, and show prompts relevant to the current step.**Technical Implementation**: UI structure with tabs for switching between steps, flexibility to go to any step (not necessarily in order), add MD files with instructions for each step, and context that videos are not just collected but integrated into the context of the entire system.**Future Automation**: For now, manual workflow with clear instructions. In the future, buttons will automatically run scripts. For now, set up basic step-by-step system, then automate each step separately.---## Tasks- [x] Create basic application structure (foundation for further logic implementation)- [ ] Analyze file structure in Researches folder- [ ] Create prototype with three tabs (SearchQ, Video Queue, Transcription)- [ ] Implement Tab 1 (SearchQ): instructions + script information- [ ] Implement Tab 2 (Video Queue): video table (use ready HTML)- [ ] Connect to files locally (without Dropbox API for now)- [ ] Add MD files with instructions for each step- [ ] Add prompt display system (button + copying)- [ ] Implement Tab 3 (Transcription): most complex - file + transcription + taxonomy- [ ] Review database options (Postgres, vector databases)- [ ] Review and restructure files for frontend compatibility- [ ] Analyze existing scripts and their application possibilities## Notes- There is a ready HTML prototype for Video Queue - use as reference- Transcription structure is still changing - be prepared for changes- Priority: local file connection, Dropbox API - later- Most complex step - taxonomy synchronization (entities, connections, IDs)- Users can skip steps (don't always go in order)- Files need to be restructured for frontend use- Existing scripts need to be analyzed for frontend application## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcripts","Short name":"Dmitriy M","Department":"Developers","Profession":"Full Stack Developer","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Available","Rate":1,"CRM time":"8:21"},{"Employee ID":"33978","Discord User ID":"1093082918441713664","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-11-27 07:01:22","Last Check Out":"2025-11-27 18:36:59","Daily Report":"Робота фулл-тайм на проекті Alternative Strategies:Creating secured PR emails for clientsAdding secured PR to Basecamp, Monthly PR secured report, and under each client's folderSearching for 2026 editorial calendars&nbsp;Writing Happy Hour Hop - Bocaditos pitch","Short name":"Olena M","Department":"Marketers","Profession":"Copywriter","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Project","Rate":1,"CRM time":"8:29"},{"Employee ID":"80802","Discord User ID":"1341755830273314858","Records Count":0,"First Check In":"","Last Check Out":"","Daily Report":"","Short name":"Karina N","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Lead generator","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"No Records","Employee Status":"Available","Rate":0,"CRM time":"0:00"},{"Employee ID":"72889","Discord User ID":"1340934988656541736","Records Count":1,"First Check In":"2025-11-27 06:32:27","Last Check Out":"2025-11-27 18:01:26","Daily Report":"# Daily Log - November 27, 2025## Instructions**What**: Record of all your activities throughout the day**Include**:- Time stamps for each activity- What you worked on- Whisper Flow transcripts from all meetings/calls- Outcomes and results---## Activities### 8:30 - Morning Start &amp; Communication**What I worked on:**- Logged in at 8:30- Responded to all Telegram messages I had- Reminded everyone about interviews- Prepared interviews in the morning**Outcomes:**- All messages responded to- Team informed about interviews- Interviews prepared and ready---### 10:00 - Interviews (Back-to-Back)**What I worked on:**- Starting from 10:00 we had interviews one after another- I had no time for anything else by the end- Reviewed responses from interviews- Invited some of today's people for tomorrow's interview- Two video editors - one refused, by the way, probably need to discuss this because maybe we should give her what she wants**Outcomes:**- Multiple interviews conducted- Candidate responses reviewed- Some candidates invited for follow-up interviews tomorrow- Video editor situation identified for discussion---### End of Day - Video Processing &amp; Communication**What I worked on:**- At the end I added two videos- Responded again to messages from those who asked questions- Reviewed responses from interviews**Outcomes:**- Two videos added to system- All messages responded to- Interview responses processed and documented---## Notes- Interviews took entire day - back-to-back sessions from 10:00- Need to discuss video editor compensation situation- Some candidates invited for follow-up interviews tomorrow## Reminder- Whisper Flow ON during all activities- Update this file throughout the day- Include all meeting transcriptsТотал 11:30","Short name":"Evgeniya N","Department":"Managers","Profession":"Recruiter","Leaves":"false","Leave Rate":"-","CRM Status":"Active","Employee Status":"Work","Rate":1.25,"CRM time":"11:28"},{"Employee ID":"258","Discord User ID":"923492994601074699","Records Count":2,"First Check In":"2025-11-27 05:36:05","Last Check Out":"2025-11-27 15:06:58","Daily Report":"Работа над списком.
