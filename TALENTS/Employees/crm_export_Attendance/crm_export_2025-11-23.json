HR Nov25 &nbsp;**Report Generated:** 2025-11-23---## Executive SummarySpent Day 23 training and working on the Task Manager dashboard for Nealova Evgeniya. Focused on improving task completion detection and statistics calculation. Identified critical issues with the current logic: file structures are chaotic across employees, making checkbox/heading detection unreliable, and the phrase-based completion detection (\"Task X completed/done/finished\") is not working effectively. The script runs locally and generates the HTML dashboard, but statistics need refinement before adding video-based training instructions.**Key Achievement:** Developed and tested task manager script, identified core issues with task detection logic that need to be addressed before scaling to other employees.---## Main Objectives1. **Task Manager Development &amp; Testing** ✅ &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Worked on task completion detection improvements&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tested statistics calculation with real employee data&nbsp; &nbsp;- Identified issues with current detection methods2. **Build Video Instruction Inventory &amp; Queue** ⚠️ Deferred &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Waiting for task manager statistics to work correctly first3. **Task Manager Blueprint &amp; Automation Contract** ⚠️ In Progress &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Script working locally, needs refinement before documenting---## Completed Tasks### 1. Task Manager Script Development- **Status:** ✅ Completed (with known issues)- **Details:** Worked on improving the task manager script for Nealova Evgeniya. The script successfully:&nbsp; - Scans Week_X/Day folder structures&nbsp; - Reads task.md, plans.md, and daily.md files&nbsp; - Generates HTML dashboard with statistics and calendar view&nbsp; - Runs locally and produces output- **Files Created/Modified:**&nbsp; - `C:\\Users\\victo\\Dropbox\\HR Nov25\\Nealova Evgeniya\\build_nealova_task_manager.py`&nbsp; - `C:\\Users\\victo\\Dropbox\\HR Nov25\\Nealova Evgeniya\\nealova_task_manager.html`### 2. Issue Identification &amp; Documentation- **Status:** ✅ Completed- **Details:** Identified key problems with task statistics calculation:&nbsp; - File structures are very chaotic across different employees&nbsp; - Checkbox detection (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) doesn't work well with inconsistent formatting&nbsp; - Heading detection (`## Task X:`) is unreliable due to format variations&nbsp; - Phrase-based completion detection (\"Task X completed/done/finished\") is not working effectively- **Impact:** Statistics show incorrect task counts and completion percentages---## Issues &amp; Blockers1. **Task Statistics Calculation Problems**&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Cannot accurately count tasks or determine completion status&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent file structures and task marking conventions across employees&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Workaround:** Script runs but produces inaccurate statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Next Step:** Develop more robust parsing logic that handles various formats2. **Task Completion Detection Not Working**&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Cannot determine which tasks are actually completed&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Root Cause:** Phrase matching (\"Task X completed\") is too simplistic and misses variations&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Next Step:** Implement more sophisticated text analysis or require explicit completion markers3. **Finance/November/public access still missing** (Discord ID mapping)&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Cannot complete Discord ID matching task from previous days&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Status:** Still blocked4. **Delivery automation tokens** (Discord/Email) pending retrieval&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Impact:** Cannot set up automated delivery channels&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Status:** Still pending---## Technical Details### Tools &amp; Files Used- Python script: `build_nealova_task_manager.py`- Output: `nealova_task_manager.html`- Test data: Nealova Evgeniya's Week_1 through Week_4 folders### Current Script Capabilities- ✅ Scans Week_X/Day folder structures- ✅ Reads markdown files (task.md, plans.md, daily.md)- ✅ Extracts tasks from headings and checkboxes- ✅ Generates HTML dashboard with calendar view- ✅ Calculates basic statistics (total tasks, completed tasks, progress %)- ⚠️ Statistics accuracy needs improvement### Known Limitations- Task completion detection is unreliable- File structure variations cause parsing issues- Statistics may not reflect actual work completed---## Next Steps &amp; Recommendations### Immediate (Nov 24)1. **Fix Task Completion Detection**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Develop more robust algorithm that handles:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Various checkbox formats&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Different heading styles&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Multiple completion phrase patterns&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Cross-file references (task.md vs daily.md)2. **Improve Statistics Calculation**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Add validation for task counts&nbsp; &nbsp;- Handle edge cases (empty files, malformed markdown)&nbsp; &nbsp;- Test with multiple employee folders3. **Add Error Handling**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Graceful handling of missing files&nbsp; &nbsp;- Better logging for debugging&nbsp; &nbsp;- User-friendly error messages### Short Term (This Week)1. **Add Video-Based Training Instructions**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Once statistics work correctly, add links to video instructions&nbsp; &nbsp;- Map tasks to relevant training videos&nbsp; &nbsp;- Create learning paths per task type2. **Scale to Other Employees**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Test script with other employee folders&nbsp; &nbsp;- Document any employee-specific issues&nbsp; &nbsp;- Create standardized folder structure guidelines3. **Task Manager Blueprint Documentation**&nbsp; &nbsp;- Document the working solution&nbsp; &nbsp;- Create automation contract for weekend build&nbsp; &nbsp;- Define data schema and import/export formats---## Notes- **Discord Update:** Message sent at 15:39 summarizing work progress and issues found- **Priority:** Fix core statistics calculation before adding advanced features- **Approach:** Focus on making it work correctly first, then add training/instruction features- **Files:** All work documented in `Week_3/23/notes.md` and this report","Short name":"Viktoriia
