**Name:** Dvoretska Sofia

My name is Sofia, and I am 24 years old. By profession, I am a biology teacher, and for some time I was involved in laboratory scientific research. I have experience working with foreign sources, reading articles in English, writing my own papers and abstracts, and translating them into English. In addition, I have experience communicating with foreigners to improve my spoken English. I would be happy to work with you. Goodbye!
