**Name:** Shkinder Kseniia

My name is Kseniia Shkinder, I’m 22 years old, and I’m currently looking for a new job. I have a bachelor’s degree in philology from Central Ukrainian State University. I studied English, German, Ukrainian, and a bit of Spanish.During my studies, I had an internship  at an agricultural company. There, I translated client emails, documents, and contracts — in English and German.
