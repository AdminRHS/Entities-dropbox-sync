# Resume

**Name:** Shelep Olha

Hi.



My name is Olya Shelep, and I'm a third-year software engineering student.



During my studies, I explored so many fields of IT, but eventually found myself most passionate about UX/UI design because it combines creativity, logic, and communication, and it really matches how I think and work.



I've already had hands-on experience working with several startups.



In one project, I worked closely with two developers, creating a complete UI kit from scratch, along with a design guideline on how to use it effectively.



Then I joined another startup with a larger team where we had daily meetings, lots of collaboration, and I focused on responsive design there.



Although I didn't make major design decisions there, I gained valuable experience working alongside a more senior designer.



And currently, I'm still working part-time at a startup where I began as a UI designer, creating a marketplace interface for their product.



But later, I also took on the role of a game designer for the same team, and I'm continuing to support them now.



As a person, I am ambitious, highly responsible, and enjoy both leading and learning.



I focus on clean, modern UI, and I have a good understanding of UX.



Although I know there's always more to learn, and I'm excited about this opportunity.



I'm really interested in this position because I see it as a chance to grow further, contribute meaningfully and take on new design challenges.



So thanks for watching and I'm looking forward to this opportunity.



Bye.
