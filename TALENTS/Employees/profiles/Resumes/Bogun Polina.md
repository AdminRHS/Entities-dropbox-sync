# Resume

**Name:** Bogun Polina

Hello, my name is Polina. I’m from Ukraine, and I currently live in Austria, where I’m studying Design of Digital Products at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

Before this, I completed an international foundation program at the same university, which helped me prepare for studying in Austria. Earlier, I studied Web-UI development at Lviv IT School in Ukraine, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These experiences gave me a strong base in both design and technology, and I really enjoyed combining creativity with practical skills.

I also have hands-on experience in UX/UI projects. For example, I worked on Sorty, a concept app for waste sorting. In this project, I did user research, surveys, and usability tests, created wireframes, and collaborated closely with a team to build a user-friendly solution.

 Another important project was a medical practice website, which I developed with a real customer in a student team using Scrum methodology. I designed the concept and guidelines, built responsive prototypes in Figma, and improved usability and accessibility. This project was very close to real professional work, and it really taught me how to work with clients and turn their needs into practical design solutions.

My main skills include UX/UI design, prototyping, wireframing, usability testing, and user research. I’m confident using tools like Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator, and I also know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy working in Agile and Scrum teams, where I can collaborate with others, solve problems, and create solutions that really help users.

What excites me most about this position is the chance to apply my skills in a real work environment, contribute to creative and innovative projects, and continue growing as a UX/UI designer. I love working in teams, exploring new ideas, and designing digital products that make life easier and more enjoyable for people.

Thank you so much for your time and for considering my application.
