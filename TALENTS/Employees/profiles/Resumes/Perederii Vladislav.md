# Resume

**Name:** Perederii Vladislav

Hello! My name is Vladyslav Perederii. I’m 23 and I live in wonderful city of Kharkiv.



All of my professional experience has been fully remote. I’m comfortable working independently. I don't have a problem staying focused, and delivering results is my priority. 



From 2021 to 2023, I worked remotely as an Account Manager  in a digital marketing studio. 

Later, I became a Team Leader Assistant in the same company, where I managed a small Lead Generation team and worked on improving onboarding process for new team members.

Currently, I work as a Customer Support and Engagement Specialist at an international dating agency, where I focus on communicating with clients and ensuring high service quality in all kinds of situations.



I have a degree in cybersecurity from Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics. I’m a native Ukrainian speaker and I know English at a Upper-Intermediate level. Additionally, I took  a programming course in Python at Mate Academy. I haven't completed the full course yet due to high workload, but i am planning to finish it in the near future. 



I use AI tools on a daily basis — not just in work, but in my everyday life as well. I primarily use ChatGPT, and also explore tools like Gemini and DeepSeek. I've also tried some other models like text-to-image solutions such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion and text-to-video products like Kling, Runway, Veo 2, but I didn’t find a use-case that corresponds with my current needs.  I've been trainig to write complex but clear prompts, and I've already learned core prompt engineering startegies such as zero-shot, few-shot, role-based prompting and CoT (Chain of Thought). This was by far the greatest investment  in my AI journey and incresead the quality of the output.



In my free time, I enjoy activities that challenges me — like programming, solving puzzles, and playing chess. These hobbies help me not only to relax but also to stay relevent and open-minded



Thank you all for your attention. I am realy exitied for this opportunity and looking forward to receiving your feedback.
