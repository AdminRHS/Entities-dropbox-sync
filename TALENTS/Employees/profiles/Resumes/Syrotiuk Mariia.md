# Resume

**Name:** Syrotiuk Mariia

Hello, my name is Maria. I’m a 24-year-old web and UX/UI designer from Ukraine, currently living in Antalya. I’m passionate about creating beautiful and functional digital experiences that make a difference.



I’ve worked on a variety of design projects, both independently and with teams. One standout project was redesigning a medical clinic’s website, where I focused on improving the user experience, enhancing online booking functionality, and modernizing the overall design. Another project was creating a website for “Save the Flowers of Ukraine,” an initiative dedicated to preserving Ukraine’s modernist architecture. In these roles, I conducted user research, developed wireframes and prototypes, and ensured the final designs aligned perfectly with user needs and business goals.



Thanks to my freelance experience, I’m well-versed in remote work. I’ve successfully collaborated with teams across different time zones, using tools like Figma, Slack, and Zoom to stay organized and maintain clear communication. Working remotely has helped me become highly self-motivated and adaptable.



My educational background is in Hotel Business and Tourism, but I discovered my passion for design and decided to follow it. I completed UX/UI design courses at Beetroot Academy and Projector Academy, where I gained expertise in user research, prototyping, and more. I’m also a lifelong learner, always exploring new workshops and trends to grow as a designer.



I specialize in user experience design, wireframing, and prototyping, and I’m highly skilled in Figma and other design tools. I also regularly use AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline my workflow and boost creativity—it’s like having an extra teammate to support me in my process.



I’m fluent in Polish, Turkish, Ukrainian, and speak English, which makes it easy for me to collaborate with diverse teams and clients.



Thank you for taking the time to learn about me—I’d be thrilled to collaborate with you!
