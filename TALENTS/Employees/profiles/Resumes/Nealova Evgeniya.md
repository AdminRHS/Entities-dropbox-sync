# Resume

**Name:** Nealova Evgeniya

Hello! My name is Yevheniia, but everyone at my previous job called me Jane to make my name more familiar for foreign employers.



So let me tell you about my experience. I have been working since I was 17. My first job was as a waitress, and I worked there for a season. Then, for one year, I worked as an assistant at the university. My duties included communicating with students, solving their problems,  quickly and smoothly transmitting information to them. Finally, I decided to change my life and find something better. Since January 2023, I worked at A1 Logistics Company as a recruiter. I found this job much more interesting due to the use of English. My working hours mostly consisted of calls with foreigners (from countries like Georgia, Tunisia, Pakistan, Algeria, and Egypt). I have been learning English for 9 years in special courses and improved it at my previous job.



I enjoy active recreation and sports. Recently, I started practicing fly yoga. Before that, I tried Pilates and stretching. I have never worked remotely before, so this will be a new experience for me. However, if you ever need to open an office, you can also consider my application, as I enjoy real-life communication.



By the way, I was born in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, and I currently live here. However, in the future, I would like to move to another city or country. Thank you for your attention! I think this information should be enough, but if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
