# Resume

**Name:** Kovalska Anastasiya

Hello, my name is Anastasia. I'm 23 years old. I'm from Khmelnytskyi. This year I finished Khmelnytskyi National University in the department of international relations with honours. My major was country knowledge. Although I have no experience in a full-time job, I participated in an initiative from our town hall this summer and interned in a tourist information centre. In this Center I communicate with our customers, managers and suppliers and have cooperation with Suspilne also make the routine work. For example, make posts and videos on our social media  Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram and create a market for souvenir products. I like this intern because I can help people  detail information or my advice and experience. After that I had a recommendation list from town hall and this centre and now I am studying in a postgraduate school in  Ostrog Academy. I prefer working in a team because you can negotiate with your colleagues and make a better decision, but when you work alone, you are responsible for yourself. What else, what about my hobbies. I like reading and walking with my dog.I think that's all. Thank you for your attention.
