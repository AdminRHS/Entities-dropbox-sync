# Resume

**Name:** Bykova Anastasiia

My name is Anastasia Bykova, I am twenty years old, and I am from Odessa, Ukraine.

   Before I decided to develop in the field of UI/UX design, I studied at an art college with a pedagogical focus in the faculty of graphic design. There I studied academic painting and drawing, created logos and product branding items.

   After graduating from college, I decided to change my direction, but remained in the field of design. I was especially attracted to the UI/UX field. I completed a six-month training at courses, where I received fundamental knowledge of web and mobile design. I mastered working in Figma: I create websites and apps interfaces there, I am proficient in creating and using components, styles, autolayouts, and wireframes. But this is only a small part of my actual skills.

   My projects are concise, easy to understand, and at the same time creative. For example, one of them is an online store of vintage items - made in the style of neo-brutalism with retro elements. Another project combines glassmorphism and neumorphism, which gave it a modern and aesthetic look.

   Also, besides Figma, i use in my projects a Photoshop, an After Effects, where I can create simple animation and an Axure, where it is easier  to create wireframes.

   My art background, ability to adapt to different tasks,  attention to details  and my desire to improve my skills make me a good specialist in my field.

   I will be glad to receive feedback and the opportunity to collaborate.

   Goodbye.
