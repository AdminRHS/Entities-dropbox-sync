# Resume

**Name:** Shtepa Yuliia

Hello everyone! My name is Yulia, I’m 22 years old, and I live in Cherkassy.



Since April, I’ve been freelancing as a UI/UX designer. I design websites and apps with a focus on user experience and clean, modern interfaces. Recently, I created a corporate website, enhanced the functionality of existing websites, and optimized CRM systems to improve their user-friendliness.



I have solid remote work experience. I’ve worked with international clients and teams online. I’m comfortable using tools like Zoom, Google Meet, and Notion to stay organized and communicate efficiently.



For my education, I completed a web design course on the learning platform WayUp. I’m also improving my skills by taking courses on Uxel, which helps me get better at user experience and interface design. I continue growing by working on volunteer projects where I practice design and teamwork.



I work in Figma, and I also use Adobe Photoshop. I create wireframes, prototypes, and design systems, and I understand the basics of responsive design and accessibility. 



I also use AI tools in my workflow. For text support, I use ChatGPT, and for creating images  I work with Microsoft Designer, Gencraft, and Gemini. These tools help me generate ideas, speed up the design process, and stay creative.



Besides technical skills, I’m detail-oriented, a good problem-solver, and open to feedback. I enjoy working with teams, managing my time well, and constantly learning to improve my skills.



I speak Ukrainian and English. My English level is B1, so I can communicate clearly in both speaking and writing.



Thank you for watching!
