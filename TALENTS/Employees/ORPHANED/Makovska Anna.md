# Resume

**Name:** Makovska Anna

Hi! My name is Anna, I’m from Ukraine. I originally studied philology, but over the past year I’ve fully shifted my focus to web development.

It’s been an intense and productive journey  - I completed an in-depth Frontend course where we built team projects and personal applications using JavaScript and React. That experience gave me not only technical  skills but also the ability to work effectively in a remote, collaborative environment - sharing tasks, reviewing code, and solving problems together.



After the course, I started doing freelance work -  mostly small React projects and UI improvements for clients. It helped me understand how to balance clean code, deadlines, and user experience.



Technically, I’m confident with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, MUI, and REST APIs. I enjoy creating clear, maintainable code and turning ideas into intuitive interfaces.



As for my personal qualities, I’d describe myself as curious, detail-oriented, and self-driven. I learn fast, and I like to dig deep into how things work instead of memorizing patterns. I stay calm under pressure and enjoy solving logical or UI challenges - that’s what keeps me motivated every day.



When it comes to AI, I often use tools like ChatGPT to automate repetitive parts of work - writing helper functions, improving text, or generating ideas. I see AI as an assistant that enhances creativity and saves time, not something that replaces human input.



I speak English and Ukrainian, and I’m happy to work with you.
