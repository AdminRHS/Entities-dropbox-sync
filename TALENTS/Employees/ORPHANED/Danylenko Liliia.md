# Resume

**Name:** Danylenko Liliia

Hi. My name is Liliia. I am a frontend developer specializing in developing responsive web pages and web applications.

In 2022, I graduated with honors from Kharkiv Kotlyarevsky National University of Arts. However, even during my studies, I found a passion for IT. What truly excites me about the IT industry is the opportunity for continuous personal growth.

Now, with over a year of hands-on experience in front-end development, I have worked with various technologies. At the core of my stack are React and Redux, complemented by TypeScript, and I use SCSS with the BEM methodology for styling. I have got a deep understanding of JS, HTML, and CSS, and I have successfully integrated various libraries to optimize project productivity.

My background in music education impacts my approach to transferring design concepts into code.

I thrive in team environments, value learning from experienced colleagues.

Let's collaborate to create impactful web solutions.
