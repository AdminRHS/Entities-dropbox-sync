# Resume

**Name:** Kachailo Anna

Hello! My name is Ann, I am 19 years old and I am working in the text processing and translation field. I am a student of the linguistics faculty, the department of the theory and practice of English translation and I have almost 1 year of experience in the position of Quality Analyst.

So, in my latest position, I was working in a company named “EditGroup” and was working with different academic paper writings, on different topics, of course, in English and I was responsible for checking the grammar aspect of those texts, proofreading them, formatting the files and correcting all the mistakes. But also I was staying in touch with customers and with writers. 

When I faced different difficult situations during the work process, I was trying to be patient and make everything step by step. For example, when clients weren’t satisfied with their papers, I was communicating with them and provided all the corrections to make the paper appropriate for the customers. 

Working online is the best and the most convenient option for me nowadays, as I use my computer almost all the time. For example, I have some texts to translate on a freelance basis occasionally on the platform Upwork. Besides, I can use a variety of tools for text processing. 

Currently, I am looking for a full-time job - It is my main priority and I’d like to work in a team. So that, I will be able to share my thoughts with other people, take some pieces of advice and use the experience of others to upgrade my current skills. 

The perfect order for me is an interesting text or even a sophisticated one for me to translate, rewrite or edit and help the client with it. 

My main priority is to become a successful and experienced employee in my field to become a part of a young developing company and make everything I can for fruitful cooperation.

I am a fast-learning, open-minded, and reliable employee, as well as, I am organized, so I follow all the deadlines. As I am a humanitarian, I like learning foreign languages, reading different texts, editing, and, of course, translating them. 

That’s all for now! 

Thank you for your attention! 

Let’s stay in touch and I hope for our future cooperation!
