# Resume

**Name:** Klimenko Yaroslav

Hi, My name is Yaroslav Klymenko, and I’m a fourth-year student at Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics, majoring in Computer Science.

I specialize in full-stack development, but my main focus and passion lie in frontend. I really enjoy building modern, clean, and user-friendly interfaces using React and related technologies.

Over time, I’ve become confident working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on the backend. I also use Git daily and follow best practices for clean code and teamwork.

Recently, I’ve started exploring Next.js and GraphQL, and I find them really powerful. I strive to learn something new every day, whether it's a new framework, pattern, or just a small improvement in how I work.

Some of my key strengths include being a fast learner, a team player, and very detail-oriented. I’m self-motivated, always open to feedback, and I enjoy solving problems creatively.

In 2025, I completed a frontend internship at Evoplay, where I helped develop landing pages and interactive UI components. I worked closely with designers to ensure high visual quality and a smooth user experience.

Now, I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow further, keep learning, and contribute to impactful projects as part of a team.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to working with you.
