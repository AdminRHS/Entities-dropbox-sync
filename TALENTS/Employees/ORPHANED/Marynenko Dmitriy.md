**Name:** Marynenko Dmitriy

(0:03) Hi, my name is Dmitry, I'm from Ukraine and I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer. (0:29) My stack includes front-end React.js or Next.js. (0:39) If I make some application for mobile, then I use React Native. (0:51) And if I need to make some desktop apps, I use a combination with Next.js or React.js and Tauri.

(1:03) This combination gives me fast launch and optimization than apps on Electron.js. (1:20) What about backend? On backend side, I mainly use Node.js with Express.js and Next.js. (1:35) I understand how to build backend with GraphQL APIs and REST APIs. (1:44) I have experience with both technologies. (1:50) Also, for databases, I use PostgreSQL with Prisma or Type4M.

(2:01) But I like more Prisma, it's more automatically and better for me.
