# Resume

**Name:** Kamenskaya Alina

Hi! My name is Alina, I’m 18 years old and I’m from Dnipro.



I have some experience working remotely. I’ve worked on two projects as an SMM manager for several months. There I acted as an independent specialist because I was responsible for creating content plans, identifying the target audience, developing marketing strategies, designing visuals, writing texts and posting.



It was a great experience for me, but now I understand that I’m a team worker. I want to work with people who inspire me, and I also believe that working in a team boosts my own level.



Now, my main priority is online work because all I need is a computer, and I can organize my working time in a way that suits me best. I really want to improve my skills, get some practicing and develop myself in this field.



I have completed several specialized courses, such as Internet Marketing and AI Specialist by Genius Space and a Social Media Marketing course from Hillel School. Now, I am ready to use all this theoretical knowledge for my work. 



I am a determined person who likes everything to be perfect. I am very communicative, friendly and highly organised. I hope to work with you. Thank you for your time!
