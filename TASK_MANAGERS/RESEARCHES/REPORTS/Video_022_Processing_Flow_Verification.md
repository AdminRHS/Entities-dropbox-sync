## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Structured Phases**: Clear separation of concerns (tools vs objects vs gaps vs mapping)
2. **Incremental Processing**: Each phase builds on previous work
3. **Documentation First**: Analysis before integration prevents errors
4. **Taxonomy Compliance**: Following ISO codes ensures consistency
5. **Cross-Reference Mapping**: Phase 7 report makes Phase 6 implementation straightforward

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Automation**: Phases 3-7 could be partially automated with scripts
2. **ID Assignment**: Could use script to query next available TOL-###, WRF-###, etc.
3. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Script to verify all links are valid
4. **Template Generation**: Auto-generate JSON templates from analysis

### Recommendations for Future Videos

1. **Consistent Phase Outputs**: Always create Phase 3, 4, 5, 7 documents
2. **Use Templates**: Standardize analysis document structure
3. **Parallel Processing**: Some phases can run concurrently (e.g., Phase 3 & 4)
4. **Quality Gates**: Verify each phase before proceeding to next
