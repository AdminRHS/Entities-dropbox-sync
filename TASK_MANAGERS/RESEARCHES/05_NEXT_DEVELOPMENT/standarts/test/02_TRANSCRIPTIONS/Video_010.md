So, so I'm sure you you're familiar with the NotebookLM. Uh we need to select sources. In this case, uh let's choose files. This is the folder where we we we're keeping all the CVs. So there are uh there there are some CVs and there should be a JD. Here you go."

Please give me a score for each candidate along with strengths and weaknesses. Right? Uh, let's see. So, let's see what we get in result. It should work. I mean, I I use it all the time for screening. So here you go."

        "timestamp": "03:20",
        "line": "So what it's done is basically it has uh top five candidates. Given the score 88 out of 100 for the first one. Just the the key requirements at the beginning. Experience, education, technical skills, knowledge. The first candidate scored um 88 out of 100 and it gives you the reason why."

Uh so this is this is brilliant, right? So, um, you know, it it it helps. Imagine if you are a hiring manager, if you are working in HR, right, and you have to uh go through hundreds of CVs for each role."

        "timestamp": "04:08",
        "line": "Uh so this has a number of, you know, uh potential use cases or, you know, practical implications uh when it comes to uh professional life. Uh so this is all free to use. Uh but I guess if we can, we we can develop a very, you know, uh we can fine tune and develop a very uh sleek application, recruitment application uh using Gemini or using any drag model uh which can fetch the data, CVs automatically from the LinkedIn post for example, compare it against the uh JD and give shortlisting, shortlisted candidate for for the interview. And it can do even more. So, uh let me ask. So can you... Based on the JD, can you please prepare HR interview questions for the shortlisted candidates?"
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "05:17",
        "line": "Now it will give us uh the potential questions for the HR interview. Let's see what we get. Right. So here you go. So this is general HR interview and what it does basically uh so this this is where, you know, it stands out. So you have a generic HR questions for which are applicable to all the candidates. For example, where do you see yourself professionally in next three to five years? What is your motivation? Tell tell us about your career trajectory, etc, etc. And then you have very specific candidate interviews. So this first candidate, of course, what LLM is doing is looking into the CV and the JD and coming up with the very specific uh questions for that particular candidate."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "06:09",
        "line": "Now let's do the next stage. Uh can you now prepare questions for technical interview for all these candidates? Uh let's make it more complex. So keep a focus on your cloud and Azure stack. So let's see. Here you go. So now we have um technical interview questions uh for all candidates first. Can you describe your experience with Azure cloud services relevant to data analytics, etc. And then then you have, you know... So let's take an example of this first candidate, right? So you mentioned experience with Azure, can you describe a specific Azure project where you are involved in data analysis and building data models? So what again, you know, what it does basically is asking Azure specific questions, technical questions, but it's looking for uh the specific information within the CV and coming up with the questions. So you don't need to really uh study the CVs in in more detail, right? So you can just rely on this tool um to to ask the questions. Uh let's ask the for the final interview with the, you know, DNA lead. Can you please prepare questions and keep focus on the consulting skills? So now what we're doing is the final interview, your focus is consulting. Um and it's gonna prepare questions for each candidate. I wouldn't say each candidate. Let's let's see what it does. Oh, it does prepare questions for each candidate. So now the focus is on consulting, right? So explain a complex data analytics concept to a non-technical stakeholder. So this is a typical non uh consulting skill. So if you're talking to uh business side or uh you know, the leadership and they are not technical tech savvy. So, you know, how would you deal with them?"
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "08:52",
        "line": "So so this is um, you know, this is about it. So you can, you know, that that's a second use we discussed one use case in another video where we were doing financial statement analysis. Now the second use case we discussed today was um shortlisting or screening of CVs and asking um questions, specific questions for each interview stage. Uh so there are a number of other use cases. I'll I'll try over the next uh over the coming days, uh I'll I'll, you know, I'll discuss, I'll demonstrate a few other use cases. Uh so NotebookLM is an amazing tool. I suggest everyone to use it. Um I use it every day. Um and it has increased my productivity significantly. So I recommend it to everyone. Uh it's a free tool to use. Um so why not? You know. So that's it uh for today's video. I hope you have enjoyed it. You have learned something new. I hope you will start using NotebookLM and some other AI tools uh over the coming days. I'll I'll do a few more videos about the AI tools and some non-AI stuff also. And I hope you are enjoying the video. You uh if you like the channel, if you like the videos, please do like and subscribe. Um and yeah, enjoy your day and look after uh for people around you and spread love. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Bye."
