Um summarize them, highlight the ones that are like groundbreaking, the ones that are incremental, and the ones that will be most meaningful uh to the areas that that I work on such as uh knowledge work and and productivity and that type of thing."

    "start": "04:24",
    "end": "04:36",

    "start": "04:50",
    "end": "05:04",
    "text": "Yeah, I I love I let me call out two things that you pointed out. I think the the CEO like getting feedback from the AI CEO before the real CEO is like a really good one. So you probably have a bunch of information about like how Drew likes to think and like, you know, that kind of stuff in there, right?"
  },
  {
    "start": "05:05",
    "end": "05:25",
    "text": "Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of a it's kind of a learning loop where um and the nice thing with dash um is that it connects to the Dropbox company sources. So documents that have Drew's feedback, document that Drew has shared with me and written, I can use that as source information to really dial it in. So it's not some generic CEO that the LLM has hallucinated."
  },
  {
    "start": "05:25",
    "end": "05:31",
    "text": "It's actually Drew based on his his writings um and kind of a an estimation there."
  },
  {
    "start": "05:31",
    "end": "05:45",
    "text": "Yeah, I feel like every CEO that we'll talk about Dash next, but every CEO should just like write a document about like how my principles, what I like to think and then like you just add it to AI project so every employee has that, you know, probably save so much grief and and time. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "start": "05:45",
    "end": "05:51",
    "text": "Yeah, it just gets everyone aligned much faster and and focused on the the things that matter."
  },
  {
    "start": "05:51",
    "end": "06:04",
    "text": "And and basically pushes my thinking like second order effects, um strategic uh advantage. Like those are all things that I should be thinking about constantly, but you know, if I'm tired, if I'm in back-to-back meetings, you know, maybe I'm I'm not as sharp as I should be."
  },
  {
    "start": "06:04",
    "end": "06:07",
    "text": "And and the LLM just helps nail that."
  },
  {
    "start": "06:07",
    "end": "06:17",
    "text": "Awesome. So so, um, I would love to see kind of dash in action. Maybe you can show us how it works and what what it is and talk about some magic moments people have with the product, like what kind of jobs to be done is trying to solve."
  },
  {
    "start": "06:18",
    "end": "06:20",
    "text": "Yeah, absolutely. Let me go ahead and pull it up."

  },

    "start": "06:24",
    "end": "06:34",
    "text": "Uh Dash is really AI powered search and organization that connects all your work apps in one place. So it makes it easy to find, organize and share company info with the right people."
  },
  {
    "start": "06:35",
    "end": "06:54",
    "text": "One of the things that we found when you talk about jobs to be done is um knowledge workers like you and me, uh there's, you know, Paul Graham famously wrote about maker time versus manager time. And if you're a product manager, you spend a lot of time in manager time, which is rapid context switching, lots of meetings, lots of follow-ups."
  },
  {
    "start": "06:55",
    "end": "07:22",
    "text": "And that time eats into our ability to do deep work, deep creative work. And so the idea of Dash is, hey, there's a lot of productivity and time that's spent in kind of these fragmented coordinating sets of work, which are important, but they eat into that really focused heads down maker time, which is so valued by by companies uh to kind of do this, you know, deeply human, deeply creative and and highly valuable work."
  },
  {
    "start": "07:22",
    "end": "07:51",
    "text": "Let's take for example, um let's let's just imagine that I'm a a creative marketing studio. I'm helping, you know, people in the entertainment industry uh with kind of their production, their show schedules, that type of thing. Um this is a very common use case among kind of the Dropbox customer base. And so, um what I'll do is I'll look for a um uh a video uh from Desert Gold."
  },

    "start": "07:51",
    "end": "08:11",
    "text": "And you can see here, this is the search results page. So it's kind of searching across a variety of different content. You can see I have a slack message here. I have some paper documents here. Um I have a bunch of Dropbox files here as well. I've got a a mood board from Miro. So it's really searching across all of my sources."
  },
  {
    "start": "08:11",
    "end": "08:34",
    "text": "Um but one of the things that Dash does really well is multimedia search. So, while a lot of these retrieval products are focused on text-based information, Dropbox's heritage is really in these creative and marketing fields where work is more than just documents. It's uh images, it's video, it's uh, you know, advertising assets, it's slides and PDFs and all of that."
  },
  {
    "start": "08:34",
    "end": "08:41",

    "start": "08:42",

    "text": "I can pull these up. You know, here's a bunch of uh scouting shots, um some some location, and I can go ahead and just kind of like click through all of the different uh scouting locations for this video."
  },
  {
    "start": "08:55",
    "end": "09:07",
    "text": "Um I can go ahead and close out of it. Um there's also, you know, video assets potentially involved with uh with this video shoot. So here I can see all the clips that are coming out uh here as well."
  },
  {
    "start": "09:07",
    "end": "09:16",
    "text": "So it gives me just a really powerful way to search across all of those uh different assets and um and just find what I'm looking for very quickly."
  },
  {
    "start": "09:16",
    "end": "09:41",
    "text": "You know, uh one of the things um that was really stood out to me when I first joined Dropbox was the realization that most knowledge workers like you and me, um companies that work in these industries, they have over 100 different SAS tools. Um and so they're spending a ton of time, you know, navigating through tabs, navigating through different search boxes."
  },
  {
    "start": "09:41",

  },
  {
    "start": "10:06",
    "end": "10:16",
    "text": "Um so, search is really important, um but like I said, it's not just about finding those uh documents. Um it's really about helping you get get answers."

    "start": "10:16",
    "end": "10:30",
    "text": "And I can, you know, if I want to go and kind of uh, you know, kind of get ready for a meeting to talk about that, I can come over here and I can create a brand new um, you know, I can create a brand new document."

What grinds my gears about like, you know, some of the Google Docs AI, like the Zoom AI is like, like I just don't like the templates that they have. Like I want to make my own template with my certain bullet point size and like my certain style. And that makes a huge difference between having to like copy and paste something into like chat GPT and try to prompt it again versus just like one click like getting the exact style that I want, you know?"

Like you spend so much time like, you know, I'll spend so much time working on my strategy document to do a review with maybe you and Drew and then, you know, go back and forth like multiple VPs review it. And then once you're done, you're like, okay, this is done. And then you just leave it there. And then do I look at it again? Maybe, maybe most likely not. I move on to the next thing."

    "text": "Yeah, absolutely. So, um, first and foremost, uh, Dash is only as good as the data inputs that come into it. So, one of the things I didn't show you is we have a product called Protect and control, which allows administrators to manage the data flowing into Dash and also manage the visibility of documents and kind of permissions within that."
