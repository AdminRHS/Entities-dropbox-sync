## 3. Word-for-Word Transcription

[00:00] **Speaker**: While other AI art tools will leave you tweaking your prompts endlessly, Mid Journey gives you advanced techniques that will give you real control over image generation. I'll start you off with the basics and then move over to the hidden techniques that will give you an edge. Now in the explore page, you can find the works created by other people, either for inspiration, for references, and other stuff.

[00:25] **Speaker**: So once we scroll down, you can see all the different styles created by Mid Journey. And I could easily start liking these and making collections that I can later use to generate my own images. So say I really like this, I can just hover over it, click the heart, and now it goes in my likes page. So these are the images I liked. If I don't like them anymore, I just click again on the heart and it just disappears. So let's go back here.

[00:50] **Speaker**: And we do have some options at the top. Right now I'm on random, which is basically Mid Journey creating a feed for me based on random images it selected. But if I want to see something really popular images, which a lot of people liked, I would go to the hot tab. If I want to see what's really popular today, top day, top week, and top month. And then of course, my likes panel.

[01:15] **Speaker**: Now, what can you do with these images? Not only can you look at them, but if you go over each one and click on them, you can see the prompt that they use to generate this image. So that is the prompt right here. Clicking once on this puts it in my prompt bar, allowing me to create something similar with the exact words. Of course, I can change this. So say I want to do, instead of a man, I want to do a woman. And let's add a few different stuff between the dark blue background and all of that. So I'm just going to hit enter and you can see it said submit it.

[01:45] **Speaker**: Now I have a zero out of one in my create tab. We'll go over there in a second. But while that's generating, I do want to show you a bunch of other stuff that you can do. So below the prompt, we have some keywords which may seem unfamiliar to you. These are what's called parameters in Midjourney. We're going to look at those later. But essentially, you're letting Midjourney know that you want it to be either a specific aspect ratio, you want it to have a different style...

[02:15] **Speaker**: Below that, you can use this image in your prompt as a reference. So you can use the entire image as a reference, the style of the image, and the prompt or the prompt that was used to generate this image. You can use multiple of these. So say you want your new character to look exactly like this character, and you want the background or the style to be the same. So the way you would use it in the style is, let's click away. Just click and drag it up here. So this right here is the image prompt. That's the style, and that is the character.

[03:00] **Speaker**: So say I wanted to use a style for this. I'm going to click on this clip right here. And now I'm just going to type in something very simple. Let's go with a woman. So just really simple, hit enter. It's going to generate it. Now I have one out of two because I'm generating two images. Another way to bring this onto the prompt bar is going down here, where we have the person who made this image. We have the reference. You can get the prompt by clicking on this T. You can hit this button to get others like this image, and then you can like it.

[04:30] **Speaker**: So the create tab is where you generate your images. So these are the two things that we kept earlier. This is with the prompt of that reference image. You can see that I don't have the reference down here. And I just changed man into woman. This is what I got. Quite different, but you can see just how detailed this is.

[05:45] **Speaker**: Down here, you can see apart from the prompt and all the other stuff, we have some creation actions. So we have vary, which is when I ask my journey to give me different variations of this very image as like new generations. I can ask for it to be subtle. So it's going to closely follow the structure and give me just slightly different versions. Or I could make it strong and have it be a little bit more bolder with the different versions.

[06:15] **Speaker**: While that's happening, let's look at upscale. So say the quality is good. It's all perfect. But I do want it to be, say, a little bit more crisp, a little bit more detailed. I can go for subtle, which is again when it's maintaining the structure of this original image. Or I could let it get more creative. So it might add some extra lines, maybe some extra details.

[06:45] **Speaker**: Or I could open this in the editor and use some of the tools to fine tune the smaller parts and then have it rerun. For example, I will grab a paintbrush and just go over her eyes, have her eyes opened. So we're going to look at that later. But this is where you would start that.

[08:00] **Speaker**: And before I get into how to take this a step further, let's take a look at how we can organize our work. So that goes all the way down here in the organize tab. You can see all the stuff we made are right below. I can filter through them... I can make folders to organize my stuff. So let's go over here, create folder, say human subjects. And there is an option for smart folders. So it's going to detect what I'm looking for, for this folder, and just automatically put that in, which I think is great.

[09:30] **Speaker**: Next, we have profiles. Now, whenever you unlock personalization, which is after you've rated 40 images on Midjourney, I'll show you where you can do that. You're going to have a profile. So now whatever I generate, unless I hide it, is going to show up on the explore page for other people to see.

[12:00] **Speaker**: Now the one that I mentioned that you would want to work through to get that public profile is in the personalize tab. So when you first start mid-journey, it's going to be locked. So mine is just off at the moment. And it wants you rate 40 images according to what you like. So it's just completely based on your preferences. It will unlock personalization for you.

[13:30] **Speaker**: So let's start with something very simple. I'm gonna go with, say, a dolphin. Hit enter... Now let's make it into a crazy prompt. So a dolphin. Let's write a vintage dolphin in a suit filing taxes within an apartment in New York City.

[14:00] **Speaker**: And we have some options. First one is image size. We can do a portrait, landscape, or use a slider to go for a specific thing... We have the models. We have the standard model, and then we have raw. So think of it in terms of photography. With raw photography, you're capturing in more details.

[15:15] **Speaker**: And these are the parameters that we were talking about earlier. So this here is aspect ratio, which would be short for AR... Weirdness is how different and quirky as the box says your generations are. So by default, it's on zero, but you can go all the way to 3000... And then variety or just chaos is when you have different creations.

[16:30] **Speaker**: Chaos is by default on 10. But to bring that up, I can do C for chaos. Dash dash. Let's go for a thousand. And then for weird, I want it to be more quirky. W dash dash.

[19:00] **Speaker**: You can use keywords from other industries into your prompting. For example, if you're an artist, you're using some oil painting technique. There's a word for it. You can use that word in here to get that similar result. With photography, you can do so many things. You can use terms like low light, double exposure, macro shots, and all of that.

[20:30] **Speaker**: Now, what if you want to give more context to your generations? You wanted to follow the specific style from mid-journey's database. So mid-journey has so many seeds. We mentioned seeds briefly before. And a seed is how that composition is structured. So you can copy that seed, put it in your prompt, and have mid-journey keep that composition from the seed but give you different results.

[22:00] **Speaker**: If you're not sure how much influence you want that seed to have, you can try different variations by adding curly brackets to your prompt. So this is what it looks like... So I'm going to do one with 0.20, 25, 0.30, 2, 1, 0.10. And you can just go on with that. Each of these comma numbers are going to be a different set of images.

[23:30] **Speaker**: Now I do want to talk about this feature on the journey, which is the remix feature. And essentially, it allows you to combine different images without having to write a crazy specific prompt... Let's try remixing this. Let's subtle and remix it with the same stuff that we see here.

[25:00] **Speaker**: That's when you can use the stop parameter... And then we're going to do dash, dash, stop, curly bracket. And this is going to be between 10 to 100. So I'm just going to do a couple of random numbers. So let's do 10, perhaps 20.

[26:15] **Speaker**: Now we can also separate concepts using the two colons. Essentially, when you add something like this, it sees it as one concept... But if you separate fire and truck, you can actually work with how much truck there is over how much fire there is.

[27:00] **Speaker**: Now one last thing that you could do is use the edit feature with any of the images that you make. You can also do it with images that you upload and use a little bit of AI... So what we have here is the erase. We have the restore, undo buttons, a reset, the size of your brush, scale, and you can change the aspect ratio.

[28:30] **Speaker**: One last thing is the exclusion function, which is when you take a prompt and you make sure that it does not include a certain thing... So let's do dash dash no cow.

[29:15] **Speaker**: I'm going to try the pan feature as well on the see which image that was on this image. Pan it to the right, down and left... And if you want to really zoom in, you can go into edit.
