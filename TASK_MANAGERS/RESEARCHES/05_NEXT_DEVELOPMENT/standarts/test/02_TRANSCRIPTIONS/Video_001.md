Video content:
[00:00] Today we're going to talk about how to use AI agents to get the most out of these creative AI tools that I'm sure you've seen and played with. I'm sure you've played with Nano Banana, maybe you've seen Kling, maybe you've seen VAYU 2.2, Sora 2, you've seen them, but you've also seen that there's some people that are able to get a hundred X out of them and other people who are just prompting it and being like, what is this slop?
[00:26] And I believe that the way to get the most out of creative AI is through two things. It's through understanding how to prompt properly and understanding different workflows. So actually stitching together multiple of these tools.
[00:38] And today we're going to go through an app called glif. I have no affiliation with them. I just saw it online and started using it recently that actually does this for you. It automatically prompts, formats it for you, work, and gives you some workflows.
[00:52] And why I think it's interesting is the people that could unleash creative AI have an unfair advantage because those are the people that are going to be able to create, uh, big audiences, ads that outperform, uh, you know, vibe coded websites and apps that don't look like every other vibe coded app. So I'm particularly interested in figuring out how to get 10X out of more with creative AI, and my thesis right now is it's through AI agents and apps like glif.
[01:25] The startup ideas podcast.
[01:28] Sippin' time. Sippin' time.
[01:33] So this is, uh, a tutorial for beginners. Um, I'm going to go through, uh, glift, we're going to go through glift together. Um, I've been using it for the last 24 hours. Um, and let's just, let's just see if it's any good.
[01:47] And by the end of this episode, I think you'll have a good idea of where prompts and workflows and tools like glif fit fit in here.
[01:56] So, uh, the four use cases that we're going to go through today. We're going to actually see how to use Nano Banana Ultimate AI agent on on glif. So we're going to try maybe creating a thumbnail, a YouTube thumbnail or something else like that.
[02:08] Uh, we're going to see how you can create, uh, these, these videos with just little, little mini figurines. Why? Because those, that type of video has actually been going viral recently and I think it's really interesting.
[02:22] Uh, we're going to talk about how you can create AI influencers. That's going to be helpful if you're going to create organic content. You want to create multiple accounts or even you may you want to create ads, right?
[02:32] Um, and then we're going to talk about how you can create, um, you know, I'm sure you were seen on TikTok, those Reddit stories, how you can create these workflows that automatically, you know, go and and and find find these stories and then create, uh, video content around that so you can create these meme pages and stuff like that.
[02:49] Uh, the whole purpose of this video is to get your creative juices flowing, uh, that you leave stronger than, uh, than you came with. So, like and comment and I have no affiliation with Glif. This is just a tool again that I've found on the internet.
[03:04] Let's get into it. So when you log into G, Glif, it's free to sign up, you're going to see that there's the workflows and agents.
[03:12] We're going to in the agents section, uh, you can see that you can actually just go and hire so to speak an agent. Uh, and that's where you kind of want to start. Why why do you want to start here is because you don't have you could obviously build your own agent or build your own workflows, but it's the simplest just to see use someone who's optimized it already.
[03:33] Uh, and this is an episode for beginners. So, uh, you can see here, uh, here's the Nano Banana Ultimate.
[03:39] Um, and if you're anything like me, you've used Nano Banana, and sometimes you get amazing results and sometimes you don't.
[03:45] Um, and I think it's because of the prompting. So let's go ahead and see if Nano Banana could go and redesign one of my thumbnails, uh, to be, um, more Mr. Beast style. Um, so I'm going to go ahead and copy this into glif.
[04:08] So I'm gonna say, Hey, I'd like you to redesign this thumbnail to be Mr. Beast esque.
[04:21] I'm gonna say to be more Mr. Beast esque. I want higher CTR, more contrast, fresher, I don't know, the stuff that gets Mr. Beast tons of views but for my type of content.
[04:41] So if I were to actually put this into Nano Banana regular, I would I would actually get a thumbnail that probably isn't the YouTube size. It probably uh, would be all over the place. My face wouldn't would look different. So let's see if it actually does something a little bit better.
[04:58] Um, so it asked me to drop the thumbnail, so I'll go ahead and drop that again.
[05:04] and we'll get to work. Cool.
[05:08] Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI just said that it is the era of the idea guy, and he is not wrong. I think that right now is an incredible time to be building a startup. And if you listen to this podcast, chances are you think so too.
[05:23] Now, I think that you can look at trends, uh, to basically figure out, uh, what are the startup ideas you should be building? So that's exactly why I built ideabrowser.com. Every single day, you're going to get a free startup idea in your inbox and it's all backed by high quality data trends.
[05:43] How we do it? People always ask, we use AI agents to go and search what are people looking for and what are they screaming for in terms of products that you should be building.
[05:53] And then we hand it on a, you know, silver platter for you to go check out. Um, we do have a few paid plans that, you know, take it to the next level, uh, give you more ideas, give you more AI agents and more, almost like a chat GPT for ideas with it. But you can start for free, ideabrowser.com. And if you're listening to this, I highly recommend it.
[06:15] So, my hope is what it does is it, yeah, analyzes the image. This is sort of the missing step, um, one of the missing steps in Nano Banana and other creative AI tools is, uh, you know, it it you need to analyze this and you need to figure out what is the best prompt based on that, right?
[06:36] So, it's a, it gives me the prompt. Here's your Mr. Beast style redesign. A high energy YouTube thumbnail redesign featuring a man with short wavy brown hair and glasses making an exaggerated shocked expression, of course. So this is very, very Mr. Beast. You can see it has the aspect ratio, so you get, hopefully get back the YouTube, uh, thumbnail in the right size, and it created three different variants.
[07:01] Red explosion, split screen, interesting that it included this because this is like a tried and trued format in YouTube when you have a slit, a, a split screen. Uh, maybe it's like a sad face on the left and a and a happy face on the right. Um, and then it asks you to generate. Okay, cool. Um, I've gone ahead and by the way, I've added $10 of credits for for this video.
[07:26] Uh, it's cool actually. I didn't see like a monthly fee. I just saw you can buy $10 of credits. Um, but you could use this for free. I I tried doing this for free and you get like a few prompts for free and if you actually want to go and create videos and multiple images, you're going to need $10 or something like that.
[07:44] Okay, so I mean, pretty, pretty amazing. Like I couldn't have gotten this out of pure nano banana. So I needed the training wheels. I needed the help here.
[07:55] Um, and I bet you, like I should AB test that. I don't know what happened to my top lip, but you know, this is the type of thing that would work.
[08:05] Um, and it's definitely, you know, it's definitely, what's also cool is I've used this image before. So now I've got this like other image that I haven't, you know, I didn't have to go into a photo shoot for. So love that it's done that. Um, and that's Nano Banana ultimate.
[08:25] Where I can see myself using this also is, you know, icons, make it a mascot, uh, for my, my startup, ideabrowser.com, uh, you know, there's so many, you know, brand identity stuff and just creating references images that you can go ahead and use in other creative AI. So, uh, I would say that this this was really good.
[08:49] It it it definitely exceeded my expectations and I can see myself using this. Okay, so the next, uh, the next demo that we're going to do is the miniature history for brand.
[09:00] So we're going to go back into, um, the agent area and you can see here, uh, this agent uses Seedream and VAYU 2.2 with Eleven Labs to create a short 32 second tilt shift, uh, and you can see here that these are the the little videos I was talking about. I just think this is cool because, um, you're you're constantly looking for as a brand, you're constantly looking for ways to tell your stories.
[09:28] And if you can tell your story in something that's like a little more interesting and a little more scroll stopping, then you you have your, you're increasing your odds of probability of success, right? So, um, we could here they're using the example for history, but I think that uh, I'd love to to give it a story.
[09:51] Um, let's just click here, tell me what you can do and and see what what what it says.
[09:56] I create historical videos in tilt shift miniature style. These short videos make complex topics seem like toy models. Here's my process.
[09:59] You give me a historical topic, an event, figure, or era. I research it to get the facts straight. I create a video plan with four varied image scenes, a narrative voiceover, animation prompts for each scene. You approve the plan. I generate everything, tilt shift images, voiceover animations, period appropriate music. I stitch it all together with subtitles.
[10:19] The result is a 40 second historical documentary that looks like it was filmed with a miniature diorama. So that's really cool.
[10:27] So, the historical topic, let's do, let's do the historical topic of Facebook going IPO.
[10:40] So I don't know how historical that is, but I'm just thinking, um, I'm just thinking like, I have this business, ideabrowser.com, which gives people startup ideas, gives them people prompts to go build those startup ideas.
[10:55] So if I'm trying to build let's say an Instagram account, um, like I might want to share stories of founders who've done a really, you know, who who've created really big companies, right? So, you can see it's gone and created the image prompts to start. So you can see like the scene one, modern glass wall office building exterior in Silicon Valley.
[11:14] The different scenes here, interior of the Nasdaq stock exchange. Young tech CEO in a casual hoodie. Um, and it's gone and create the the voice over script. May 18th, 2012, Facebook prepared for the most anticipated tech tech IPO in history.
[11:30] Mark Zuckerberg's social network would go public. Shares price at $38. So it's gone and actually researched with perplexity, uh, to go and and actually get the facts straight.
[11:42] Of course, if you're doing this, I would want to make sure, just double check that it's it's correct, you know? Perplexity could be wrong. Um, then it gives you the video animation prompts.
[11:52] So it does it for C dance light, which is great, right? Because for most of us, we would just probably go into SORA 2, um, we wouldn't be stitching together C dance or and others like that.
[12:03] And it goes and does it and says, and it says, uh, does this plan work for you? We're just going to say just generate it, um, but you could adjust the scripts, uh, you could change the video style format if you don't like it.
[12:16] Um, and now what it's doing is it's, uh, it looks like it's creating all the, yeah, are you kidding me? Yeah, this is crazy. Like that's the reference images. How cool is that? How cool is that? And that's the audio. So it created the audio here.
[12:43] Uh, and then it says, do you want to generate the video? So we're going to go ahead and generate the video and see what happens.
[12:52] So it's going and creating the videos. Um, and a lot of people will look at this and and be like, this is so silly, right? Like, why? Like historical videos, like it's so silly. How is this going to make me money? How is this going to get me followers? How's this going to get me likes? Well, I think it's obvious how it's going to get followers and likes.
[13:12] I think the the non-obvious question is how does this, how does this help my business? And whenever you're, you know, when you're thinking about, you know, building your your business, you know, I always think about it like this. I call it the ACP funnel. I've talked about it on the pod before.
[13:30] You first create an audience, then create a community, then create a product.
[13:37] So, it's literally a funnel. It's literally a funnel and I think, uh, you know, you start with an audience and you can tell stories. This is where you can tell stories and this is where creative AI really plays a huge role.
[13:52] And then from that, you know, maybe you create a paid community, IRL events. And then from that, you're going to figure out what your product is. And that's when you vibe code something, and that's when you sell it to them.
[14:02] So, this is sort of the framework I use when I create any of my businesses, when I'm buying businesses, when I'm investing in businesses. And I think that this gives you the highest probability of success. Let's go back to the glif.
[14:16] So now what it's doing is it's mixing the background, so it's actually created background music at a low level.
[14:21] So it knows that it's not just doing voice voiceover, but it knows that people like background music, right? Like these are the the nuances that you might have forgotten if you were just creating this on your own.
[14:34] And this hasn't taken that long. I mean, we're talking about a few minutes. Like this, I I've paid agencies to do this sort of stuff and it's thousands of dollars. Um, and it's ready. So, within about, I don't know, five minutes, we've been able to do it.
[14:49] Uh, and let's go ahead and watch it.
[14:52] May 18th, 2012. Facebook prepared for the most anticipated tech IPO in history. Mark Zuckerberg's social network would go public. Shares priced at $38 on Nasdaq, but technical glitches delayed trading, investors grew anxious as the system struggled to keep up.
[15:11] Zuckerberg retained control through special voting shares, but behind closed doors, underwriters had quietly cut their revenue forecasts days earlier. The stock barely rose on day one. Within weeks, billions in value vanished. The dream IPO became a cautionary tale of hype.
[15:32] So, I mean, is it perfect? Absolutely not. Like, you could've brought Tom back. Um, oh, now it's adding music, the the background music. Like, not bad. Okay, adding subtitles to the video. So, um, I would say like, it's not bad.
[16:15] Like, in the sense that Like it's not bad. Like it's not, it's close. It's like the last 20% that you need to get to, right? Um, but overall, like I I am impressed.
[16:27] The last use case we're going to show is these TikTok Reddit stories. So, I'm sure you've seen this on TikTok, you know, the Minecraft videos, basically, it's brain rot for sure, but, you know, some people love them. This has 43,000 likes. Um, you know, if you can find a way that you can use Reddit for these interesting stories, post it, uh, and create audiences, create likes and ultimately sell some of your software or startups, that's, that's what you, you know, is a viable channel for you.
[17:03] So, can Glif figure that out for us? So, I'm going to say, go and create an awesome TikTok video from the r/SaaS subreddit. Why why from the r/SaaS subreddit? If I'm doing this for, you know, ideabrowser.com, you know, SaaS subreddit, I'm sure it has a bunch of start, you know, people who've built software as a service and they're, you know, I would want to attract those people, right?
[17:36] So it's gone ahead and used web search, XO web search, it's found how I built a $1 million SaaS just by posting on Reddit. Um so, classic hustle story, underdog story.
[17:48] Um, and then it asks you to pick your style approach, drama, educational, mystery, lifestyle. And in this case, educational, like we want to teach people about building software and building SaaS. Um, how fast do you want to go? Ultra fast, fast, medium, slow? Probably like pretty fast. Um but it's cool that you're able to, you know, drip feed that context into it.
[18:15] Do you want to gen z, brain rot, balance or thoughtful? Let's go with more of a balanced vibe. Let's go with another balanced vibe. Um and let's say we want to do 60 seconds. I'm actually surprised that, uh, you're able to do such long videos within within Glif. You know, I think it would be like 10 seconds, 15 seconds.
[18:37] Here you can see that it it's created seven clips that are 8 and 1/2 seconds each.
[18:41] Oh, so that's it. It's basically creating these clips and it's stitching it together. You can see that it's, uh, created the audio. Um, you can see here, it's created the audio.
[18:52] And it's going to go ahead and stitch it together for us. So, what did we do today? What did we do today? We got the most out of Nano Banana with the Nano Banana Ultimate AI agent. We created a miniature AI documentary, really cool, and we didn't even research the script at all. We had Perplexity do it. We created an AI influencer.
[19:28] Uh, it did take eight minutes, but, come on, not not too bad. Uh, and then we created a story, a Reddit story, grabbed information from Reddit, uh, and created almost like stock footage with a audio on top of it that could be used to create audiences uh and share our stories. So, overall, I think it was really cool what we did today.
[19:54] And uh, kind of exceeded my expectations. I don't know about you. I think I'll end this episode by saying there's all these different agents and different categories, the video, image, the social media, uh, you know, if you want to create podcasts, you want to create a product influencer. And video and image, you know, V03 Master Prompter, you know, Kling 2.5.
[20:21] How do you create, you know, Hollywood special effects in your pockets? So there's a bunch of them here.
[20:29] Um, you can go ahead and create your own agents and your own workflows. Um, but, you know, it's really, in my opinion it's advanced. Like, I would use the regular agents to start like before your creating these custom instructions, custom memories. But it's cool to see what you can do, right? You know, you can go and search X for, you know, a specific topic, and then it runs a deep research report and then it creates, you know, text to image with flocks and so there's so much that you can do.
[20:51] But I would say, you know, from a beginner perspective, uh, play with agents. Um, see if you get something more out of, you know, the the creative AIs that exist. Um, you know, I think if if you, you know, if you've stuck around this long, you're seeing that a tool like Glif is helpful, right? Um, so, uh, hope this has been interesting to you. Hope it's gotten your creative juices flowing.
[21:28] And, uh, let me know what you want me to review next. Like, is there any tools that you think are interesting? Should I be doing more of this stuff? Uh, and, uh, you know, have a creative day, my friends. This is the greatest time in history to be building startups, to be building audiences, to be building communities. And I can't wait to see what you build next.
