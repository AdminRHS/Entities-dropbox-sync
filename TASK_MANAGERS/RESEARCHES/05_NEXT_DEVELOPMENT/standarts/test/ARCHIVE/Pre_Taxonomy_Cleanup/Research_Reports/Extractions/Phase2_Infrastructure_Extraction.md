✅ Proper taxonomy with ACTION + OBJECT + TOOL + CONTEXT
✅ Communication platforms use "Discord server" (not Slack)
✅ Sequential IDs from Phase 1 highest per department
✅ Source tracking complete for all entities with line numbers
✅ Quantifiable outcomes in all skills (660 files, 2,212 migrations, 27 tools, 31 tasks, 505 lines, 32 employees)
✅ High automation potential scores (60%+ for 8 of 12 tasks)
✅ Very High reusability scores (83% of tasks)

### Infrastructure Focus Achieved
✅ Large-scale file operations (660 files, 2,212 migrations)
✅ System configuration expertise (logging, GitHub Actions, Docker)
