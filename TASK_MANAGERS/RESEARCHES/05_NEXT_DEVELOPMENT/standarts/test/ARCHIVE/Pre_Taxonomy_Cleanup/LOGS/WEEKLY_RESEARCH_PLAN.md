- [ ] **No active employees confirmed** - Waiting on Finance data

### Risks
- **Risk:** High priority tasks not assigned due to employee availability
  - **Mitigation:** Check Finance folder today, assign by end of day
- **Risk:** Research quality inconsistent (no historical data)
  - **Mitigation:** Provide clear guidelines, quality review all submissions
- **Risk:** Estimated times inaccurate (no baseline)
  - **Mitigation:** Track actual time, adjust estimates weekly
