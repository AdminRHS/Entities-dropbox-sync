## Department Notes

**Challenges:**
- ❌ **No dedicated SMM employees identified**
- Gap in workforce structure for social media
- Relying on cross-department support

**Opportunities:**
- ✅ Design team can handle content creation research
- ✅ Lead Gen team has social media scraping experience
- ✅ Existing influencer tracking data in VIDEO_RESEARCHES
- ✅ PMT-045 exists for SMM document processing

**Assignment Strategy:**
1. **Content Research** → Assign to Design team (Shymkevych, Safonova)
2. **Analytics/Tracking** → Assign to Lead Gen team (social media scraping skills)
3. **Influencer Research** → Assign to Video team (existing influencer data)

**Recommendations:**
- Consider hiring dedicated SMM employee
- OR: Cross-train Design/Lead Gen employees in SMM
- OR: Designate SMM responsibilities to existing employees
