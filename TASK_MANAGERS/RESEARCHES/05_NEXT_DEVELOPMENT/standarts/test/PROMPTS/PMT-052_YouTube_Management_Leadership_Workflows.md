   - Identify which pain points are addressed
   - Note integration opportunities with current stack
   - Check if systems mentioned align with our approach

3. **Prioritization & Tagging** (5 min)
   - Assign watch priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Tag by tutorial level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
   - Tag by management category
   - Tag by implementation difficulty

### **Step 4: Action Planning & Distribution (15 minutes)**

1. **Create Learning Plan** (5 min)
   - Identify high-priority tutorials to watch first
   - Group related tutorials for learning paths
   - Schedule time for implementation

2. **Share Findings** (5 min)

## 📋 Research Best Practices

### **DO:**
✅ **Focus on organizational systems** - Prioritize management frameworks and systems
✅ **Look for complete implementations** - Prefer end-to-end system tutorials over quick tips
✅ **Check publication dates** - Ensure content is from last 30-60 days
✅ **Verify management relevance** - Content must be management/leadership focused
✅ **Document thoroughly** - Complete templates for future reference
✅ **Capture resources** - Download templates, frameworks, guides
✅ **Map to current systems** - Connect tutorials to our RAG, performance management, etc.
✅ **Assess implementation** - Consider how easy it is to apply in our organization
✅ **Track channels** - Bookmark creators for ongoing monitoring
✅ **Create learning paths** - Group related tutorials for structured learning
✅ **Focus on remote context** - Prioritize tutorials addressing remote team challenges
✅ **Consider AI-first context** - Look for AI transformation and adoption strategies

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Waste time on non-tutorials** - Skip reviews, announcements, or promotional content
❌ **Ignore date filters** - Only include content from last 30-60 days
❌ **Skip documentation** - Document immediately, not later
❌ **Focus only on new systems** - Also look for new techniques with existing systems
❌ **Overlook implementation details** - Prioritize tutorials showing complete setup
❌ **Ignore remote considerations** - Ensure tutorials address distributed teams
❌ **Forget organizational context** - Ensure tutorials work for 32-person organization
❌ **Skip resource downloads** - Capture templates and frameworks while available
❌ **Forget to share** - Distribute valuable tutorials with management team quickly
❌ **Ignore metrics** - Prioritize tutorials showing results and ROI
