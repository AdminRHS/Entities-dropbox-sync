## 📋 Research Best Practices

### **DO:**
✅ **Focus on practical value** - Prioritize actionable content over theory
✅ **Consider multi-role applications** - How does this apply across Sales/SMM/PA roles?
✅ **Check single-person team relevance** - Is this scalable to solo operations?
✅ **Document thoroughly** - Complete templates for future reference
✅ **Capture resources** - Download templates, scripts, workflow files
✅ **Map to current tools** - Connect resources to Zoho, Sales Navigator, etc.
✅ **Assess implementation** - Consider how easy it is to apply learnings
✅ **Track sources** - Bookmark creators for ongoing monitoring
✅ **Create learning paths** - Group related resources for structured learning
✅ **Consider coordination needs** - How does this help cross-departmental work?

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Waste time on non-educational content** - Skip reviews, announcements, or promotional-only content
❌ **Ignore single-person context** - Skip enterprise-only solutions
❌ **Skip documentation** - Document immediately, not later
❌ **Focus only on new tools** - Also look for new techniques with existing tools
❌ **Overlook multi-role benefits** - Consider how resources apply across all roles
❌ **Ignore coordination workflows** - AI and support automation is valuable
❌ **Skip resource downloads** - Capture templates and files while available
❌ **Forget to share** - Distribute valuable resources quickly
❌ **Ignore current November focus** - Consider coordination and admin support needs
