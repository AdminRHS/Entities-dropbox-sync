- **Geographic Distribution**: Ukraine, Austria, China, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Moldova
- **Approach**: Template-driven operations with centralized knowledge management

### **Current Management Systems**

#### **1. Framework Implementation & Architecture**
- **3-Tier File System**: Company → Department → Employee hierarchical structure
- **Employee Mini-Frameworks**: 10-20 templates per employee (vs 1,000 department-wide)
- **12 LIBRARIES Taxonomy**: 429 Actions, 36 Objects, 75+ Tools, etc.
- **Frequency-Based Ranking**: Priority by usage, not chronology
- **Performance Impact**: 16x faster processing, 10-20x less tokens

#### **2. RAG Systems & Knowledge Management**
- **Organizational Brain Metaphor**: File system as brain structure
- **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline**: 7-step methodology (Action → Object → Responsibility → Skill)
- **Bidirectional Indexing**: Fast retrieval system
- **Daily Notes Processing**: Structured taxonomy population
- **ENTITIES Architecture**: Two-tier system (Operational + Framework layers)

#### **3. Team Training & Development**
- **Half-Day Training Sessions**: 4-hour blocks, weekly per department
- **Research Task Distribution**: Learning through research, double benefit (learning + content)
- **Snowball Task Model**: Tasks compound in value over time
- **Onboarding System**: Automated file generation, structured first week
- **Individual 121 Sessions**: 30 minutes weekly, personalized feedback

#### **4. Performance Management**
- **Early Adopters Only Policy**: Focus resources on innovators and early adopters

- **File-Based Performance Metrics**: Daily files, research outputs, documentation quality
- **Attendance Tracking**: CRM integration, Discord voice presence, screenshot requirements
- **Combined Dashboard**: Quantitative + qualitative metrics

#### **5. Strategic Decisions & Cultural Shifts**
- **10 Major Strategic Decisions**: RAG system priority, Ship Weak Iterate, Early Adopters Only, Individual 121s, Direct Client Communication, Retention Over Replacement, Employee Mini-Frameworks, Hierarchical Files, Frequency-Based Ranking, Documentation Over Explanation
- **Cultural Transformation**: Wiki → RAG, Perfect-then-release → Ship weak iterate, Group → Individual accountability
- **Innovation Adoption Curve**: Focus on first 50%, let bottom 16% self-select out

#### **6. Automation & Integration**
- **n8n Workflow Platform**: Primary automation tool
- **MCP Connectors**: Claude integrations, GitHub automation
