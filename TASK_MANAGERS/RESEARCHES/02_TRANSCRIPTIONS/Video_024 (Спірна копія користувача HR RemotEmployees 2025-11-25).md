My name is Daryl. Today in this video, I'm going to walk you through a complete tutorial on how to use n8n step-by-step. n8n is an automation platform tool that allows you to connect different applications and services together. You can also do really interesting things like scrape emails from Google Maps, find trending topics on Reddit, and automatically create YouTube videos with AI and even upload them, plus a whole lot more.\n\n[00:22] **Darrel Wilson**: So first, let me touch base on exactly what n8n does. I'll then give you some real-life examples, and then I'll show you what we're going to cover today in this tutorial. So n8n is an automation platform that allows you to automate virtually any task you can think of. You can think of it as a platform that acts as a bridge between your applications and doing some sort of service.\n\n[00:39] **Darrel Wilson**: Instead of moving data manually or repeating the same tasks over and over, you can build an automation process that runs on its own. For example, a contact form submission on your website can instantly be recorded in Google Sheets and also be sent to your Slack channel. You can also send yourself a copy directly into your Gmail account all at the same time.\n\n[00:56] **Darrel Wilson**: So in this video, I'm going to walk you through three methods on how you can use n8n. We will first start by using a basic contact form and exploring modules and how to set up your automation workflow. We will then take this information and upload it to Google Sheets and also send high ticket emails directly to your email or even Slack.\n\n[01:11] **Darrel Wilson**: And for all of you AI lovers out there, I'll even show you how to automate these tasks with a webhook so you can connect your favorite tool, app, or contact form with n8n. Lastly, I'll show you how to create your own AI agents. And what's even better is I'll show you how to embed it onto any website.\n\n[01:25] **Darrel Wilson**: Your AI agent can do anything you want. But in my case, I'll use my AI agents to give users the latest information on cryptocurrency and also politics. So first, let's hop on over to n8n. Now there is a link in the description. This will take you to n8n and this is where we're going to create an account and then I'll show you around the interface.\n\n[01:40] **Darrel Wilson**: Okay, and this is n8n. Now at first glance, I'll be honest, it is a little intimidating, but after you use it for a little bit, it ain't that bad and you'll get the hang of it. So once you get to this page, you'll click on Get started for free. On the next page, you'll then go through the process of making an account. So you put in your full name, your company email, you confirm it, yada, yada, yada.\n\n[01:58] **Darrel Wilson**: And then you'll put in your account name. Now this is going to be your login URL, so make sure that you put something here that you recognize. And once you fill out all this information, you'll then click on Start free 14-day trial. Now later down the road, if you decide to use this platform full time and you really find this platform valuable, n8n's pricing can be a little expensive.\n\n[02:16] **Darrel Wilson**: You know, they start at around 24 Euros a month and go all the way to 800. If you decide to use this platform full time, I definitely recommend to get it from Hostinger. They actually have self-hosted n8n and the prices are a lot cheaper. So you'll pay something like seven bucks a month for a very optimal plan. And we do have a coupon code for it and I'll put that in the video description. So that's always a cheaper route down the road.\n\n[02:37] **Darrel Wilson**: Now going back to n8n, so once you fill out your information, I will then meet you in your customer dashboard. Okay, so at first it might ask you to create an instance and this is essentially like a workspace. So I'll click on Open instance. On the very next page, you're going to see that you're brought to an overview. Now you obviously, you're going to have nothing here, but this is essentially where you start going to create workflows for automation.\n\n[03:03] **Darrel Wilson**: So to create your first workflow, here at the top, you'll click on Create workflow. And this now brings you to the n8n editor. Now let me explain how all of this works, what the nodes are, and then also what a workflow is. First, let's talk about workflows. It's a step-by-step list of instructions you give n8n to follow automatically.\n\n[03:20] **Darrel Wilson**: For example, the recipe might be like: When someone buys something from Shopify, send them an email, log an order in Notion, and notify me on Slack. The whole chain of events is the workflow. Next, we have Nodes. Nodes are the individual building blocks or tools in the workflow. Each node has one job. For example, a Gmail node sends an email. A Slack node sends a message. A Google Sheets node adds a row.\n\n[03:41] **Darrel Wilson**: You can connect these blocks visually and are the foundation of what you want to automate. So now that we understand what nodes and workflows is, let's talk about what starts all the process. This is called a trigger. So what starts the actual process of automation? This is called a trigger. Every workflow has to start somewhere, right?\n\n[03:57] **Darrel Wilson**: Well, that's the trigger. A trigger is what starts the whole process in motion. On Shopify, the trigger could be something like New Order. On a contact form, it could be something like A Form Submitted. You can also even have time triggers that run every Monday at 9 a.m. So just remember this: To get started, you must have a trigger. You then must connect it to a node, and that's pretty much it. After that, you've just created a proper workflow.\n\n[04:17] **Darrel Wilson**: Okay, so let's get started. Now the first thing that we're going to add is a trigger. A trigger essentially is going to trigger the entire workflow. So I'll click on Add first step. And on the right side, you're going to see that you have a variety of triggers. Now there are webhook calls where you can connect this with other applications like AI, Shopify, WooCommerce, or whatever.\n\n[04:35] **Darrel Wilson**: But let's just start from the basics here and select On form submission. And I'll walk you through how all this works. Now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to build a contact form. An On form submission actually is a contact form builder. They don't say that, but that's what this really is. So here we have the form title. We'll go ahead and select Contact Us.\n\n[04:55] **Darrel Wilson**: For the form description, I'll put something, you know, like they recommend, \"We will get back to you.\" Now here we have form elements. So what do you want to add on this contact form? Well, you probably want Name, Email, and a text area. So for Add form elements, I'll click on that. And now we're going to first add in a Name.\n\n[05:14] **Darrel Wilson**: Now here you have Element type. So you can add in a variety of different types such as email, dropdown, file, you know, number, password, whatever. But we're going to select Text. And for the placeholder, we can put, you know, Name or nothing. I'll just put Name. We're going to add another element. And this is going to be Email.\n\n[05:31] **Darrel Wilson**: And for the element type, we're going to select Email. For placeholder, I'll put Email as well. And I'll make this required. I really want those emails, so I'm going to make this required. And the last part is a text area. So this is going to be the Message, right? Message. For element type, we're going to put Textarea. And then placeholder be like Your Message.\n\n[05:56] **Darrel Wilson**: And I think that's pretty much it. So at this point, we built our form. Now if you want to take a look at this, here at the top, I'll click on Execute step. And this is what our contact form looks like. So we have Name, Email, and then also Message. So we've just built a contact form. So now that we've done this, what do you want to do with this? What do you want to automate?\n\n[06:12] **Darrel Wilson**: Well, let's go ahead and select an action. So let's go back to our n8n form. And I'll click on Back to canvas. So the next thing I want to do is I want to take all these leads and I want to store them in a Google Sheets. So let's do that. Here I'll click on the plus. And now we have What happens next? So essentially this is where you're going to perform some sort of action.\n\n[06:30] **Darrel Wilson**: I'm going to type in Google Sheets. And you're going to see that Google Sheet pops up. If we just type in Google, you're going to see that there is a lot of other tasks that you can integrate this with such as Messages, Google Drive, and a whole 'nothers.\n\n[06:56] **Darrel Wilson**: But for now let's stick with the basics and we're going to select Google Sheets. So the next thing is, okay, what do you want to do with Google Sheets? Well, I want to click on Append row in sheet. Essentially what I'm saying here is I want to add all the contact form information from my contact form onto my Google Sheets. The next thing we're going to do is open up Google Sheets.\n\n[07:12] **Darrel Wilson**: So this is Google Sheets. And all you got to do is have a Gmail account, you can log in, and then you can create Google Sheets for free. So here I'll click on Sign in. Okay, now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a Google Sheet. So right here, I'll click on Blank spreadsheet. And here we have columns and rows. Now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to actually create specific rows for the actual elements.\n\n[07:35] **Darrel Wilson**: So the first one was Name. The second was Email. And the last one was Message. So essentially what I'm saying here is I want all the names here, I want the emails, and then the message here in a really nice clean format. So let's hop on over back to n8n. So the next thing we're going to do is log in with Google.\n\n[07:52] **Darrel Wilson**: So right here I'll click on the Credential to connect with. And you're going to see I have a few that I've already connected with. But you as a new user, you're going to click on Create new credential and you're going to click on Sign in with Google. This is going to take you to log in with Gmail. And once you log in with your account, it'll then redirect you back to n8n.\n\n[08:22] **Darrel Wilson**: So now that we connected Gmail, here you'll see that we can now go ahead and access the account. In my case, it is the Account 3. Now for Resource, we're going to leave this as Sheet within document. And then for Operation, you want to make sure that this is Append row. Append row is essentially you are now going to add something in a specific row based off information entered on your form.\n\n[08:44] **Darrel Wilson**: So I'll select Append row. And then here we have Document. Now I have a variety of documents that I've worked with, but I'm going to go ahead and select this form here. This is Untitled, but I'm going to change this to n8n Tutorial. And press enter. And once I do that, I'll go back to n8n. So then I'll select n8n Tutorial.\n\n[09:02] **Darrel Wilson**: And for the Sheet, I'm just going to select Sheet 1. Okay. Now the next option here is Mapping column mode. So here you'll see that we have Name, Email, but we don't have Message. Now if we select Map automatically, you're going to see this disappears. So what we want to do here is we actually want to have n8n fetch everything for us. So what we're going to do here is click on Execute step.\n\n[09:24] **Darrel Wilson**: Okay. Now we're going to fill this out. Now this might not make sense right now, but you'll understand why we're doing this in just a few seconds. So go ahead and fill out your form. Here we go. And then I'll put in a message. I'll click on Submit. And once we do that, on the bottom right, you're going to see there was a problem. And that's okay. We're getting that error because we entered nothing in the Values to send.\n\n[09:46] **Darrel Wilson**: But we executed this step in order to generate the schema here on the left side. So now that we've done that, here we have Name, Email, and also Message. I'm going to take Name and drag and drop it into Name. Also, we're going to take Email and drag and drop it into Email. And then we're going to take the Message and we're going to drag and drop it right here under Message.\n\n[10:06] **Darrel Wilson**: And after that, we're all good to go. So now we can actually run this to see if it's all working. So I'll click on Back to canvas. And now we're actually going to run a test event. So after we've done that, the next thing I want to do is Execute a workflow. That essentially means like this is a test run. I'm just seeing if everything's connected.\n\n[10:22] **Darrel Wilson**: So I'm going to click on Execute workflow. And what that's going to do, that's going to prompt the contact form. Now remember, once I fill this out, all this information will automatically end up in the Google Sheet section because we actually added the JSON schema onto the Value input section. So let's go over here... and let's fill this out. So this is Darrel Wilson... and this is going to be Howdy.\n\n[10:46] **Darrel Wilson**: And once I enter this in, this information will automatically be stored over here in the sheet section. So there it is. All right. So it just took like a few seconds and now it's automated. So that's how you can basically start automating your form onto the actual Excel spreadsheet. But we're not done yet. You know, that was just a very bare basic introduction.\n\n[11:06] **Darrel Wilson**: Let's do other tasks. So we've actually added this to Google Sheets, but what else do you want to do? Maybe you want to actually submit this information to other platforms. So next, let's say you have a contact form with specific prices that you want to be notified if a user is selecting a high price on your contact form. The first thing I want to do is add it in.\n\n[11:24] **Darrel Wilson**: So I'm going to scroll down here and for Form elements, we're going to start adding in prices. So I'll click on Add form elements. And for the Field name, this is going to be Price. Okay. And for the Element type, we're going to select a Radio buttons. Okay. And the first one is $1,000. And the second one is going to be $5,000.\n\n[11:55] **Darrel Wilson**: Make sure not to put the dollar symbol because that could interfere with the actual schema. So now that we've done that, I'm going to take this and I'm going to drag it up here. Okay. So I want to put it above that. So we have the Price and then we have the Message there at the bottom. So I'll click on Back to canvas. So now that we've done that, now let's add in some other tasks.\n\n[12:15] **Darrel Wilson**: So over here, I'm going to take this circle and we're going to drag it over here. Now I want to be alerted by Slack if someone selects $5,000. Cause if someone's willing to pay five grand, I want to know right now, right? So let's do this. Now before we do that, we're going to select IF. So this is going to actually filter specific prices on your actual form.\n\n[12:35] **Darrel Wilson**: So if someone selects 5,000, I want to be notified via Slack. If not, it'll just go to my Gmail accounts. Now notice here we don't have Price. So what we need to do is we need to actually execute this step in order to generate the JSON schema for Price cause we just entered that in. So I'll click on Execute step. And then we're going to go back to Back to canvas and now we're going to run this one more time.\n\n[12:54] **Darrel Wilson**: So Execute workflow. And we're just going to fill this out. And we're only doing this because we want to generate the schema for our forms. Submit. And after we've done that, if we go back over here to the IF section, if we double click, you're now going to see that we have the option for Price. Okay. So I'm going to take Price and I'm going to drag it under Value 1.\n\n[13:19] **Darrel Wilson**: And if true is what? So if someone actually enters in $1,000, I want to be notified via Gmail. So I'm going to put Is equal to 1000. So just to reiterate here, the $1,000 is equal to true. So if the price is equal to 1000, this is true. If it's false, it's going to go elsewhere.\n\n[13:40] **Darrel Wilson**: So if the user selects $1,000, who wants to be notified? Well, I want to put Gmail. So I'll click on the plus and I'm going to select Gmail. Click on Gmail. And I want to click on Send a message. So here we have the input on the left side. So for example, I first want to send this to my email, darrelporto@gmail.com. And then the subject is New Lead.\n\n[14:05] **Darrel Wilson**: New Lead. Now for the Message, we're going to take the Message right here and we're going to drag and drop it right there. You can also drag in the Price as well or any other information. So you could put like the entire thing like the Name, the Price and everything else. Now if you want more space to write and you want this a little bit more cleaner, you can actually open this in a new tab and you can actually reformat this.\n\n[14:25] **Darrel Wilson**: So for example, we'll put that. And you can also type in here like, \"Hey Darrel, you have a new lead!\" And then it'll show the Message, it'll show the Price, and also the Name. So you can rearrange this however you would like. And you can also drag in these elements here like the Email and stuff like that just like that. And these will all be directed to your Gmail account.\n\n[14:43] **Darrel Wilson**: So I'll go ahead and close this now. Okay. And click on Back to canvas. Now if someone selects 5,000, that's actually false, right? Because it doesn't equal 1,000. Therefore I want to be notified via Slack instead. So I'll click on plus and type in Slack. Okay. And we're going to click on Send a message.\n\n[15:04] **Darrel Wilson**: Send a message. Okay. Now I've already connected my Slack account. So right here I'll just select my Slack account. You'll just need to log in with Slack just like you do with Gmail. And for the Operation, we're going to select Send. Send message to, and then you have the option to a User or a specific Channel. In my case, I'm going to select Channel.\n\n[15:21] **Darrel Wilson**: And we have a lot of channels in my current school creation lounge. So I'm going to select All n8n Lounge. And for the Message text, I just want to open this On form submission. And you can choose to, you know, do this however you want. You can add in the Name, the Email, the Message, and the Price. I'll just put in the Price and also the Message here. Okay. Just like that.\n\n[15:46] **Darrel Wilson**: And I think from here we're all ready to go. So let's go ahead now and click on Back to canvas. And now let's test run this. So let's go ahead and open up my platforms automation tool and let's click on Execute workflow. And we're going to actually run this. So if I go ahead and fill this out... Now if I select 5,000 and we enter something in, this will automatically be sent to my Slack, but not my Gmail.\n\n[16:14] **Darrel Wilson**: So I'll click on Submit. And if I go over here really quickly and I wait just a few seconds, you're going to see that we now have the actual message. Now if I go to my Gmail accounts, you're going to see that we have nothing because it did not meet the criteria. Now let's try this one more time. So if we try this one more time, but this time we select 1,000, it's going to go to Gmail.\n\n[16:36] **Darrel Wilson**: So Darrel... fill this in, click on Submit. We'll go to Gmail and I'll just go ahead and wait just a few seconds. And there it is. Okay. It actually took a little bit longer. So I'll open up this email. And then you're going to see, \"Hey Darrel, you have a new lead!\" And this is the Message, this is the Amount, and then the Name and also the Email.\n\n[16:58] **Darrel Wilson**: So that is a quick way on how you can start utilizing this platform in order to automate tasks with n8n. And also don't forget, if we go over here to our Excel spreadsheet, you're going to see all that information is automatically stored in our Excel spreadsheet. Making it really convenient to add in leads automatically.\n\n[17:15] **Darrel Wilson**: Now many of you watching this probably do not want to use the On form submission. I totally get it. I personally would not want to use their On form submission either. I've actually created another video where you can actually make your own contact form with AI, a beautiful contact form that looks something like this where if users fill it out, it has like a progress bar and you can actually grab this contact form completely for free.\n\n[17:39] **Darrel Wilson**: I've actually created another video where I embedded this onto my WordPress website. So this is WordPress and I took that contact form, I embedded it onto my WordPress website, and then I actually used n8n to automate this form. So you can actually create forms with AI, embed it onto your WordPress website, and also automate it with n8n.\n\n[17:58] **Darrel Wilson**: If you do want to learn more about how to automate contact forms made with AI with n8n, I will leave this tutorial in the video description. The only difference here is that all you really do is you just add a webhook. It's really simple to set up. So essentially it'll be the same thing except for the On form submission, it'll just be a Webhook trigger. So the only difference is that this right here will just be a webhook and that'll automate the entire process with an AI form.\n\n[18:24] **Darrel Wilson**: Now once you're ready for this to go live, all you're going to do is click on the Active up here and that is now going to automate this entire thing. So as of right now, you no longer need to click on Execute workflow. This right here, if you double click, you are going to use the Production URL and this is now the new contact form that will be fully automated. So I'll go ahead and click on this and I'll paste it in.\n\n[18:46] **Darrel Wilson**: And now this is the actual production contact form. So as of right now, this one is actually working all by itself. It's fully automated. And all you got to do is just fill this information in and you're going to see now it is fully automated and you don't have to like, you know, click on Execute workflow. So as of right now, this is in production mode and it's fully automated.\n\n[19:04] **Darrel Wilson**: Okay, so now that we have a basic understanding of how to use n8n, let's step it up a little bit and create an AI agent and also add it to a website. So let me walk you through how to do that. So the first thing I want to do is create a new project. So here at the top, I'll click on the plus. And under Workflow, we're going to create a new one under, you know, my Personal or wherever.\n\n[19:24] **Darrel Wilson**: And that's going to allow you to create a new workflow. So now let's create an AI agent. Now in this specific case, I want to create an AI agent that pulls the latest information from cryptocurrency and also politics. So let me show you how to set this up. Now the first thing I want to do is I want to set up a trigger. So here I'll click on the plus.\n\n[19:37] **Darrel Wilson**: And here we have a few options. And this time we're going to select On chat message because this is going to be an AI chatbot that users can actually talk to on our website. It's going to be really cool. So I'll click on On chat message. And I'll click on the Make chat public. I mean, you don't have to do it, but you can just turn it on right now anyways, you'll have to do it later. So I'll go ahead and now close that.\n\n[19:58] **Darrel Wilson**: And now we're going to actually click on the plus and now we're going to click on AI. Once that's done, you're going to see that we have the option for AI Agent. Let's click on AI Agent. And now you're going to see that we have a variety of options. So I'll click on Back to canvas. Now let me explain this. So the Chat Model is essentially the model of what the AI is going to use in order to process this information. The Memory is going to store the information there. And the Tool, this is like the actual skill. So this is like what the AI is going to actually do.\n\n[20:25] **Darrel Wilson**: So the first thing that we're going to do is select an AI Chat Model. I'll click on plus. Now there is a large variety to choose from. There's ChatGPT, there's Gemini, there is DeepSeek and a few others. Now for this specific case, I'm going to select the Google Gemini Chat Model. Okay. And once I do that, I'm going to have to get the API key.\n\n[20:45] **Darrel Wilson**: Now I've already integrated mine, but what you'll do here is click on Create new credential. And here you have some options. You have the Host and also the API Key. Now the first step is going to Google AI Studio. So here I'll click on Google AI Studio. Now this is where we're going to get the Gemini API key. So here at the bottom left, you'll see Get API key. I'll click on that.\n\n[21:04] **Darrel Wilson**: And right here you're going to see I have a few that I've created, but we're going to click on Create API key. And here I'll actually select a project. So you will need to actually go to Google Cloud as well, create like a basic project. And once you do that, you can then click on the actual project that the API will be used for. I have a lot to choose from, but in this case I'll just select New Project Darrel.\n\n[21:23] **Darrel Wilson**: And I'll click on Create API key in existing project. So this is my API key. I'll go ahead and copy this. Go back to n8n. And I'm going to now paste this over here. So I'm going to paste this over here. Okay. And then I'll click on Save. Okay. So you're going to see that this was successfully connected.\n\n[21:44] **Darrel Wilson**: Now in case you do not know how to create a project in Google Cloud, all you got to do is go to cloud.google.com and all you're going to do is click on the Console. And here at the top, you'll click on the actual project and here you'll click on New project. Now once you create a new project, this is actually going to automatically sync up with Google AI Studio.\n\n[22:01] **Darrel Wilson**: You're going to see right here that I have a lot of projects and these will automatically be pulled up from the Google AI Studio. So when I clicked on the Create API key, all this information is coming from the Google Cloud projects, which is essentially right here. So that's where that information is coming from. Okay. So once that's done, I'll close this box.\n\n[22:19] **Darrel Wilson**: And here you can select the model. Now I believe 2.5 Flash is the latest model, so we're going to select that one and click on Back to canvas. The next thing we're going to do is give it Memory. So this is basically allowing it to remember what it's doing and stuff. I'll click on the plus. And right here we have Simple Memory. I'll click on that and that's all we have to do.\n\n[22:41] **Darrel Wilson**: Now real quick for Context Window Length, I want to put something like 30. This is essentially how many tasks it can process at one time. So if you have five, that's kind of limited. So I put 30 just because that gives it a lot more room to talk to a lot more people at one time. So that's why I selected 30 for that specific parameter. Here I'll click on Back to canvas.\n\n[23:00] **Darrel Wilson**: So now that we have the actual model, we have the memory, now let's give it a specific task. So right here we have Tool. I'll click on the plus. Here we have some Recommended Tools. We also have some Vector Stores and then we also have Other Tools. Now essentially the point of all this right here is you're actually giving this AI agent a specific skill.\n\n[23:19] **Darrel Wilson**: For example, if you wanted to actually connect with ClickUp, you can have users ask messages about specific ClickUp or you can connect it with your own project and then you can tell it to do something and it'll automate it for you. Now there is a variety of, I mean there's a million ways on how you can connect this with different apps, but we're going to keep it very basic.\n\n[23:36] **Darrel Wilson**: We're going to type in RSS. And here we have RSS Read Tool. I'll go ahead and select RSS Read Tool. And then here we have the Description and also we have a URL. Now there is actually a really great website that has the most modern information for pretty much anything on the internet. So this is RSS.app. Now this is a website that actually has a variety of different RSS feeds and you can feed the actual AI all these RSS feeds to get all the information.\n\n[24:00] **Darrel Wilson**: Now I'm already logged in. Now you can sign up completely for free. You don't got to pay anything whatsoever. They only charge you like once you're selecting like a huge amount of like different RSS feeds. Now to get started with, I'll click on Plus New Feed. And here we have a variety of different websites. We have Topics and also Newsletters.\n\n[24:17] **Darrel Wilson**: Now there's a lot of ways on how you can do this. So for example, if you wanted to pull like information from Twitter, if I click on the Twitter RSS feed, users can get the latest information from a specific Twitter page. They can also do this for a specific Instagram or specific YouTube video or channel or Telegram or whatever. So it's going to pull all the information from these websites and give it to the AI agent.\n\n[24:40] **Darrel Wilson**: So I want to create an AI agent that revolves around politics and also cryptocurrency. So let's go over here to Topics. Now right here we have Celebrities. We can select like something like Donald Trump. I'm sure that's a very trending topic. People want to know like the latest info about him. So I'll click on Donald Trump. And then there are tons of different news stories about Donald Trump.\n\n[24:59] **Darrel Wilson**: So right here you're going to see we have some from New York Times, we have Newsweek, and a few others. Now what we can do is we can take this feed and save it and then feed it to the AI. So I'll go ahead and copy this. Go back to n8n. And I'm going to now paste in the URL right here. Okay. So it must end in an XML. Now for the Description, we're going to give it some instructions.\n\n[25:20] **Darrel Wilson**: So here we go. \"Reads data from an RSS feed. Give the user the latest information when asked about politics and Donald Trump.\" So there is the URL. And now click on Back to canvas. So at this point we're pretty much ready to go. So we can test this out by making this Active. And then right here we have When chat message received. I'll double click on this.\n\n[25:38] **Darrel Wilson**: And we're going to take this Chat URL and we're going to put it in the browser. Okay, so this is our functional AI agent. Pretty cool. So this guy's name is Nathan. How can I assist you today? \"What has Donald Trump done this month?\" And then we're going to wait for a response. And the great part about this AI agent is that this is actually more efficient than ChatGPT because as you can see, this is pulling real current information about Donald Trump.\n\n[26:04] **Darrel Wilson**: So for example, he charged about $100,000 for an H1B visa. And recently he also introduced the Trump Gold Card which allows people to come to America and pay a million dollars. Now this is all current information. So your chatbot will be able to feed users the latest information on any single topic that you want to give them.\n\n[26:21] **Darrel Wilson**: So going back to our automation, I'm going to double click on When chat message received. So here we have Mode. And I'm going to click on Embedded Chat. So now we can take this chatbot and put it onto any website. Now in order to do this, right here you'll click on this here button and this will actually give you the actual code and then we're just going to copy and paste this onto our website or any HTML website and you're good to go.\n\n[26:43] **Darrel Wilson**: We're going to scroll down... and this is the CDN embed that we need. So we're going to copy this. And you can place this onto any website. Now the only thing that you're going to have to change on this HTML code is the Production Webhook URL. So right here where it says YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL, you are going to use this specific link right here. So this link will replace that.\n\n[27:09] **Darrel Wilson**: So let me walk you through how to do that. I'm going to go to my WordPress website and we're going to go to Dashboard. So here's my dashboard. Now real quick, the plugin that I am currently using, I'll just go ahead and show you, is called WPCode Lite. And here is the plugin that I'm using. It's called WPCode. Now this is the one that I am currently using, so if you want to follow along, you can install this plugin.\n\n[27:29] **Darrel Wilson**: Now once you install this plugin, you're going to get this option right here called Code Snippets. And we're going to click on Header and Footer. Now we're going to scroll down and you're going to see Footer right here. Now I've already added this on my website, but I'll just walk you through it one more time. So I'm going to paste in that code and now you're going to see that we have the code, but it says YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL.\n\n[27:46] **Darrel Wilson**: All we're going to do is go back to n8n, we're going to copy this, go back to our WordPress website, and we're going to paste it in there. Just like that. Make sure there is no typo. That looks perfect. Okay. And once you do this, you'll click on Save Changes. Now all you have to do right now is go back to your website and it should appear at the bottom right of your screen.\n\n[28:06] **Darrel Wilson**: All right. So here is my website. This is actually a tool website that can actually minimize images and do all sorts of stuff for images like resize them. I actually made a video on this and if you do want to check it out, it's for free. I'll put it in the video description. But anyways, here I'll click on the chatbot. And this is Nathan. I'll put \"What has Donald Trump done this week?\" Let's see what it gives us.\n\n[28:31] **Darrel Wilson**: Okay. So right here you'll see that it gives us a lot of information about what Donald Trump has done this week. Now it didn't include the links. So what we can do is just ask it like, \"Can you link me?\" And voila. So now it's giving us all the links for these specific articles. Now how can you use this for your specific niche?\n\n[28:46] **Darrel Wilson**: Well if you're running like some sort of tech website, you might want to pull RSS feeds from a bunch of different tech websites to give users the latest info. If you're running a cryptocurrency website, you might want to integrate a crypto agent where it can give you all the latest coins and all the latest new, you know, scam coins or whatever. And you can, you know, tell your customers what's trending, what's not trending.\n\n[29:06] **Darrel Wilson**: But that's why you would want to incorporate an agent onto your website. It gives the user more information about that specific topic and it gives more current information than ChatGPT. Now this was just a basic crash course on how to use n8n. Now I will be having a school opening in just about a week or two and we have three instructors and we're going to teach you everything that you need to know on how to create more advanced workflows with n8n.\n\n[29:27] **Darrel Wilson**: Just to give you an example, right here you'll see that this is actually a lead generator and this will actually scrape all the information from LinkedIn. It'll take all the emails, put it in a specific form, and also auto message users who create new accounts. And for those of you who want new leads for your business, we've actually created a very complex workflow right here.\n\n[29:44] **Darrel Wilson**: This will actually go ahead and scrape a variety of different platforms. It'll take specific emails from Google Maps and a few other places and it'll actually put them in a perfect column in Excel spreadsheet. So as you can tell, these are a lot more advanced. So if you really want to make use of n8n for more complex topics and scrape tons of different leads, I will be having courses on all that and you can access our school in the video description.\n\n[30:06] **Darrel Wilson**: It does look really interesting. So yeah, I'll be in there myself. If you want to come on inside and join us, we'll be all there waiting. I hope you all enjoyed this video. If you guys have any questions for me about automation or anything else, let me know in the comments below. And I'll do my best to get to all of your comments.
