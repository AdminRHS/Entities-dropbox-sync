3. Word-for-Word Transcription
[00:00] If you think Cloud Code is just for developers, you're missing something huge. Cloud Code runs my entire business. And I'm not a developer. This is not about coding. It's about business leverage. In this course, I will show you every feature and mechanism in Cloud Code that matters for business. Not theory. Not fluff. Real tasks. Real results. Cloud Code solves every limitation I've faced with JGPT, GMI, or even Standard Cloud. The memory problem. The context problem. The scattered work problem. Gone. I am Darren Wiener and I coach business owners in the world's first AI community. The AAA by Liam Otley. For the last three years, I've spent thousands of hours building systems with AI agents for real business scenarios. Now, let's dive in.
[01:03] OK, let's start. Why are we stuck with JGPT and other AI tools? First problem is context window management issue. We are limited by the context window. And the models, whatever the platform, Cloud, JGPT, GMI, take whatever platform, they all have the same problem. The models lose performance as the context fills. There is loss of details. The models forget important stuff and at the end, hallucinate. Another big issue is the siloed sessions. You cannot share context across chat sessions or across projects or between custom JGPTs in an easy manner. And it's a real problem when you're working on complex projects with different information scattered among different folders, different subprojects or different locations inside Cloud, JGPT and so on. Really, that's a huge limit.
[02:00] Then there is another problem, which is the self-orchestration problems. In JGPT, you can use teams of custom JGPTs, but you have to call them manually using the add command. In Cloud, you cannot do this. In Janina, you cannot use multiple teams in one chat session. And so in all those tools, you have to orchestrate manually, either with a command like in JGPT or copy-pasting stuff between chat sessions, between projects, between gems, between different chat sessions. And so that's painful. Another thing that is painful with these tools is the connection with external tools. Let's face it, you can connect JGPT with connectors or Cloud with connectors in Cloud, but it's still very early and it's still basic.
[03:00] For instance, the Google Connector, the Google Drive Connector, Google Sheet and Google Docs Connectors, you cannot even have your custom JGPT or your Cloud project write Google Docs. That's crazy. So it's useless for me. And in addition to that, even if you use the OpenAI schema with custom JGPTs inside JGPT, it's clunky, let's face it. It's techy. It's not straightforward. I hate it. And when you use it, it's really painful. You have to always authorize connection and so on. That's, wow, my God, that's so hard for nothing, right? So the capability to connect with external APIs is really limited. Then you have all these other tools like N8n, Mac.com, Zapier, and so on, all these automation tools. And at the end of the day, when you want to do automated workflows, you need to combine all these tools. It's really techy. Once again, it's brittle. Even if you don't pay any money, you will spend time. It's expensive to build, expensive to use, expensive to maintain. And it becomes obsolete very fast. Think about it. OpenAI just released Agent Builder when I'm recording this video, which means tools like N8n or Mac.com, most likely, they can be threatened by that. Who knows if N8n will still be something in six months? Not sure.
[04:40] I'm not making any prediction here because I don't know and anything can happen. But just to show you that these complex tools, you take time to learn them and then you have to learn something else because now it's not the best way to do stuff any longer. Once again, what we do here is not technical. We want to use simple AI tools that are evergreen. Let's face it, if you work with just GPTs, it will last longer than working with specific AI tools. And here, what I will show you, working with Cloud Code is definitely the future and it is there to stay for a very simple reason. Entropiq is investing massively on upgrading this tool, maintaining this tool, making it better, adding features, adding capabilities. So it's just the beginning, which means it's the right time to jump on trade.
[05:45] And side note here, Cloud Code is initially a tool that is built for coders. But actually, you don't need to know any code to work with it. And in particular, with what I will show you, which means using Cloud Code inside Visual Studio Code and with the Cloud Code extensions, you will see it's like an experience that is quite close to a chatbot. So you don't need any tech skills to use what I will show you. And the original thing that we do in CCGD and that I show you in this course is that we are using Cloud Code not for code, but for business-related work. Using AI agents, using processes, systems inside Cloud Code, leveraging the capabilities of Cloud Code, but for business purpose. And that's really super powerful and super easy, actually. Once you have the right system, once you know how to use Cloud Code capabilities in a business context, that's pretty straightforward. So now let's see how to install Cloud Code in a few seconds.
[06:48] It's very easy to install Cloud Code. I recommend to use Visual Studio Code. It's free. And then to install Cloud Code extension. And then the only thing that remains to be done is authenticate with paid cloud subscription. And once again, I recommend you to use your paid cloud subscription rather than the API, because you can also use Cloud Code with the Entropic API. But if you use the Entropic API, you will pay for every token you use. And I don't like this approach. Why? Because basically you're paying for mistakes that AI will do. When AI consumes too much content, it's because AI is not effective enough to do the job in a limited amount of tokens. I don't want to pay attention to the number of tokens that the AI is using. So that's why I recommend to use a paid cloud subscription. So let me show you how it looks. First, you go in Visual Studio Code. And here, you choose the right one for you. I'm on Windows, so I would download the file here. And I would just execute it. And I would just follow instructions. It's really straightforward. Then when you are in Visual Studio Code, you go in extension here. You look for Cloud Code. And here you have Cloud Code for VS Code. You click on that, and then you can install it. For me, it's already installed. So I won't do it. But you click install, and it will do everything alone.
[08:15] And the first time that you launch Cloud Code, and to launch Cloud Code, you just have to be in a folder. So let's open a folder like this one, for instance. Once you're there, you just click on a file or somewhere. And you will see that here, you can launch with the upper right corner. You can launch as many Cloud Code sessions as you want. And so the first time you connect with Cloud Code, before having this beautiful interface, you would have something that says, hey, authenticate. And then you can choose the method between API or between your Cloud subscription. And I recommend to use the Cloud subscription. And it's pretty forward. You click on it. It will open the browser. And then you just say, accept. I just read what is on screen. Follow the process. It's really, really easy, straightforward. And you're good to go. As easy as that. And you see, no coding, no nothing. It's pretty simple. And you will see, Visual Studio Code is really simple, because it's a bit like Windows. You have folders with files. And you can navigate your computer there. And then you have a bunch of features in Visual Studio Code. But that's not the point of this course to explain that to you. You will discover. You will see it's pretty straightforward. Just a quick tip. You can see in a Cloud Code session here, I have access to the past conversation. Here, I don't have any. But in a folder I have worked on, for instance, that one. Here, if I open another Cloud Code session, now I have past conversations. OK, so that means I can find my past conversation if I need to. So pretty simple. That's it. You now, you're ready. First thing to understand is the memory system. This is what we will cover next.
[10:00] Yeah, when you first connect with Cloud Code, or sometimes when your access token has expired, Cloud Code will tell you that you need to log in again. And so you use the command slash login. And then you will end up on this screen. And then that's where you can choose between Cloud AI subscription or Entropy Console, which is the API, or this. I've never used that. And so you click Cloud AI. Then you have this box. You say yes. Then it opens this in your browser. And then you just click authorize. And you're good to go. Then you go back to your interface, Cloud Code interface.
[10:45] The cloud.md file, that's your business brain. Or that's the brain in more general context. That's the brain of Cloud Code. The cloud.md file is a bit like a system prompt. And actually, you can have a cloud.md file in any folder you are working on with Cloud Code. This is some sort of permanent instruction files that you can use in each folder and for each project you're working on. Really, it's like a system prompt. If you have worked with a chat GPT project, it's like the custom instruction for chat GPT product. Or if you have worked with custom GPTs, it's like the system prompt of a custom GPT. And same for Cloud Project. If you've worked with Cloud Project, you have custom instructions for Cloud Project. So here, the cloud.md file is the same concept. The thing to understand is that for each folder, you can have a cloud.md file. And so if you have a folder with subfolder and so on, you can basically have a hierarchy of project folder. And for each of them, you can have a cloud.md file. And the cool stuff is that each time you open a Cloud Code session inside a folder, it will look for a cloud.md file to get instruction and context of what we were working on in this folder. In this course, I will call folder project. It's the same. I will use the two words for the same concept.
[12:15] So obviously, the advantages of that is that you don't have to re-explain a project context or a business context. You can have different instructions per project or per folders. You can compound the knowledge because each time you're working on a project, you can ask to update the cloud.md file so that the permanent memory or the system prompt, if you prefer, is always up to date. So it's super powerful. You can also use that to have some mechanism that Cloud Code will execute. When it opens, you can, like, really the sky is the limit with this. Super effective. Cloud Code can help you design the cloud.md file, of course, but you can also decide and tell Cloud Code to put stuff you find important for a given project or given folder inside a cloud.md file. So let's have a look at the cloud.md file. Here I am in my CCDG business operation. And if I open a project, for instance, this one, you can see here I have a cloud.md file. And you can see here, this is the markdown file with information about the project, the scope, etc. Okay. And if I go in another subproject, for instance, this one, once again, I have a cloud.md file somewhere.
[13:40] So now, cloud has memory and context with the cloud.md file. What if you need multiple AI teams working in parallel? That's where sub-agents come in. Sub-agents are AI workers inside Cloud Code. The cool stuff with them is that they are specialized AI assistants. They have isolated context windows. Each context window has 200,000 tokens available to the date of this video. That means you don't pollute the main context when you're working with agents. The cool stuff with agents is that Cloud Code can call them automatically, invoke them, and Cloud Code can run them in parallel or can run them sequentially according to the work they are doing. The sub-agents have access to the files in the folder you're working on, and so they can communicate with each other using the files they have access to, or Cloud Code can also pass context. I've seen that Cloud Code can pass information from one agent to the other, sharing context. Okay, this is technical. It doesn't really matter. Just Cloud Code can orchestrate automatically sub-agents, sharing context between the different agents, even if each sub-agent has its own context window. So the advantage is you can run multiple tasks at once. So you can go faster. You can specialize them as well. So that can be a team of specialized sub-agents that work on the workflow, orchestrated by Cloud Code, not by you. You don't have to do it. Of course, if you want to specifically ask Cloud Code to work with a given sub-agent, you can do it. No problem. But that's super useful. And at the end, what a sub-agent is, it's a .md file.
[15:20] So let's look at this. This is my GPT Express Mastery team. I call that my HR department. This is where I build all my sub-agents in Cloud Code and also where I build all my custom GPTs when I'm working on ChatGP. And so an agent is, you can see here in my HR team, I have several agents. They correspond to my GPT Express Mastery framework, if you've watched the course inside CCGD community. And if I open one, this one, for instance, you can see that an agent has always the same metadata here. And in the metadata, I have the name, I have the description of the sub-agent, its mission. That's what Cloud Code will use to know what the sub-agent does and also to invoke automatically the sub-agent if the task matches the description. You can specify the model. You can specify a color, especially if you're working on terminals, so you can see what agent is working. And you can also specify the tool it has access to. It's optional, but you can do it. The classical procedure to create an agent in Cloud Code is using the command agents and here, configure agents. I will have to continue in terminal because here I'm in the extension for Visual Studio Code. But if you want to make the slash agents come and work, you need to go into terminal. So if I go in the terminal, it looks like this. And then I have the list of agents I have access to in my system. And if I want to create a new agent, I can just click here and then I can choose between project or personal. If I put my agent in project, that means the agent is available at the project level in the folder I'm working on. If I put it in personal here, that means the agent will be available everywhere. That's a hierarchy of availability that is true for agents, for skills, for MCPs, all the key features of Cloud Code. You can either have them available globally or have them available locally. I won't create any agents because once again, I don't use this approach to create agents. What I use to create agents is my HR team. And for instance, here I have my team working on an agent. It's an example that I started just to show you. I just said, hey, I need an agent that can answer questions about Cloud Code for business. Then what did Cloud Code? It's refined my demand, or at least it identified inputs it needed and started answering the inputs automatically so that I can review. I said, okay. And then what it did, it created a folder that is this GPT project, Cloud Code Business Expert. It's in there, Cloud Code Business Expert. And then it called multiple agents to work on this sub-agent creation or this custom GPT creation. First, the purpose refiner that refined the purpose statement. And here it's a better definition of what the agent is meant to do, better than what I did initially. And then you can see here that the to-dos of Cloud Code, using different sub-agents to work one after the other, executing my GPT Express Mastery Framework to craft custom GPTs. And then you can see a good example of parallel execution. So it's not sub-agents that are executing in parallel. Here it's the web search tool that is used by Cloud Code in parallel. So that means Cloud Code is making these different queries in parallel to go faster. Okay, a bunch of query to collect knowledge. And then it's fetching several URLs to collect knowledge, some other web search queries, and it's still making some research. Okay, and then after we'll craft the knowledge base and then the system prompt and then potentially some tools. And then I'm good. I have my custom GPTs on my sub-agent ready to rock and roll. I call that my HR team. And this is something that is available in CCGG here in the Cloud Code OS so that you can plug it immediately, just copy paste it and have it available inside your Cloud Code environment without spending time setting this up. It's already done and available in Cloud Code OS.
[19:40] So sub-agents handle complex tasks, but what if you need reusable workflows or standard SOP, standard operating procedure, that activate automatically and that Cloud Code can call in anywhere globally, which means these are standard way of working that you can use in any project anywhere in Cloud Code. That's skills. Okay, consider skills as reusable workflows or standard operating procedure, which means when you know how to do something well and you want it to be done always the same time by Cloud Code, you will create a skill. And this skill can be called in any folder, in any project. So the key feature of skills is that Cloud can trigger them automatically, can use the skill automatically according to the work you ask it to do. It will detect context match. Then skills are re-optimized for context window using a mechanism that is called progressive disclosure, which means when Cloud Code uses skills, it won't load the entire skills. It will just start discovering what the skill is about, reading the beginning of it, and then reading more if needed. And that's really super useful for context window optimization. Another cool thing with skills is that skills mix deterministic code. You can put scripts inside skills and also knowledge files that can be processed by LLM, which means you combine both worlds. Code for deterministic tasks and LLM for flexible AI automation or AI execution, let's call it. And finally, another stuff that is cool with skills is they are shareable, which means first and foremost, you can use them globally on your system in many different projects. You don't have to specify again. They are available. And also you can package them and share them with other people, for instance, with your customers or for instance, with your teammates, which means you can enforce SOPs. You can ensure that your teammates using Cloud Code or your employees using Cloud Code will use the right SOP because you've shared a skill with them. And guess what? In the Cloud Code OS, I'm sharing the skill I use for myself and I build for myself. I share them with you so that you can use them right away. It's copy pasting. So simple.
[21:50] So like I told you, the advantage of skill is context window friendliness. And you know how much context window friendliness matters for a large language model performance. They are reusable across projects globally anywhere from Cloud Code, except if you put the skill in one single folder, then they are available only on this folder. But if you put them globally, and this is what I advise you to do, if you put them in the .cloud subfolder in your user folder, they are available globally. Cloud decide automatically how to use them. If you want to be ensured that Cloud use the right skill, you can also tell it to use the right skill. And the cool stuff is that you build once a skill and you can use it anywhere. And guess what? You can also improve the skill, right? So let me show you what a skill looks like. Okay, here I'm in the .cloud folder in my user folder on Windows. And so that means everything that is there is globally available everywhere in my Cloud Code environment. Let's check skills factory. Guess what? When Entropiq released skills a few weeks ago, three weeks ago now, the first thing I crafted is a skill to create other skills. Obvious. I did that in the past. The first custom GPT I created, or maybe the third one I created is a custom GPT to create other custom GPTs. And back in the day, the first sophisticated prompt I created, it was what I used to call meta prompt, was a prompt to create other prompts. It was in February 2023. Anyways, so this is how a skill looks like. A skill, as always, a skill.md5. Any skill has a skill.md5. You can see here, there is another one, etc. And so a skill.md5, as once again metadata, you will see that in Cloud Code, all files, all system files, let's call them that way, as always a metadata that helps Cloud Code understand what it is, what it does, when to invoke it, right? So here, same for skills. We have a skill.md5 with this metadata, the name of the skill, the description of the skill, as simple as that. And then you have a description of the skill, what it does, the process inside. Basically, it's defined how Cloud Code should do the work when it's supplying these skills. You can see it's a pretty short file, right? And if we check the outline of it, you can see in this specific one, if we check the outline of the skill.md5 for the skills factory, there is the metadata, there is a more extended description of what it does, there is a skill creation process, there is some troubleshooting, there is some reference documentation, and that's the progressive disclosure. When Cloud Code sees reference documentation, it sees how I have some other document I have access to. So potentially I can retrieve them, some example skills, some script, and some version history, okay? See it as a table of contents. And then in the skill, I have some other documents. So that's knowledge about how to do the skills properly. And you can have also code. Here I have some scripts. So these are Python scripts that Cloud Code will execute when it's using the script.
[25:00] I can give you an example about how skills are used. For instance, I have a skill that is my standard operating procedure to create new projects inside my business OS. That's the project creator skill. And so let me show you how it looks like in real life. If I am in my CCGG business operation system, so that's the one, let's create a project using a skill, okay? By the way, this operating system has many super useful processes, mechanism, and so on, that makes it super effective to run any aspect of my business. And guess what? It's available in Cloud Code OS so that you can copy-paste it with all the mechanism and the routine already set. And you can tweak them and make them specific for your own business. And of course, the implementation calls inside Cloud Code OS are meant to help you customize it for your business. These implementation calls are group calls we do about each system I share inside Cloud Code. And it's also Q&A calls so that when you have questions about implementing your Cloud Code OS systems, I can help you. Back in the main topic. So here, let me illustrate how to use skills. How a skill is used by Cloud Code. So I will create a mock project so that I can show you the project creation skill to create the project the right way inside my CCGG business operation. So that would be a mock project just to show you how it works. Hey, use the right skill to create a project inside CCGG business operation. That's a mock project just to demonstrate how you invoke skills to do stuff specifically here to create a mock project, right? Oh, that's a clunky ask I did here, but it should work. So here you can see it's calling the skill project creator and it's reading, it's discovering the skill. That's progressive disclosure. Then the process is normally asking me some questions about the project. But here it has understood it's a mock demonstration. So it's just answering itself, following a procedure. And then I say, yes, that's good. Let's go. And it will create it. And so now it will follow the process to create the mock project as defined in the skill. So it will create project structure, generate the Cloud.md file, see Cloud.md file, what you should have in any project. A readme.md as well. Then do some other stuff that are defined in the skill. OK, I will stop there. OK, if you have created anything, please clean that. It was just an example. OK, thing to remember about skills, the progressive disclosure mechanism, the mix of deterministic script code, which is really reliable, and LLM that is more flexible. And you can mix that inside a skill if you want to ensure that the skill is used. Normally Cloud.md code auto-invoke the skills, but sometimes it might just try to do it on its own, especially if it's simple tasks you're asking. So if you really want to enforce the skill, mention the skill when you ask Cloud.md code to do something.
[28:20] So definitely skills are super powerful individually. But what if you run multiple skills and sub-agents at once? Call that parallel execution. Let's have a look. We already saw a bit how to do this with sub-agents or tool calls, like when I showed you web search in the previous example. Let's talk a bit more about parallel execution. So the cool stuff in Cloud.md code is that you can execute in parallel either tool, either sub-agents and sometimes just Cloud.md code sessions. So the basic two approaches are multiple sub-agents in one session. And in this case, Cloud.md code will invoke multiple sub-agents simultaneously to do a workflow. Once again, each agent will get an isolated context window but can share information. Either Cloud.md code gives different information to the different sub-agents to coordinate them, or you can use also files inside your folder that these agents have access to to refresh their context, share information, share their work. The cool stuff is that Cloud.md orchestrates automatically. You cannot do this in Cloud or Gemini or these other AI tools. Cloud.md code here allows you to do it. The other approach is to use multiple Cloud.md code chat sessions, which means you open several Cloud.md code windows inside the same folder or sometimes in different folders. And each session works on a different topic. Here, it's you who orchestrate and check what they do. Something to understand, if you want to orchestrate multiple agents or if you want to have Cloud.md code orchestrating multiple agents, you can do it in parallel if there are no dependencies. If task A done by agent A doesn't need task B's output, and if they're working on different files, you want to avoid having two agents working on the same files at the same time in parallel because it's messy. So the advantage here obviously is massive time saving with parallel execution. And really the way I see it is I'm the CEO and I distribute work among my teams. And so that's why most of the time I'm working with multiple departments. Here, I'm working with my operational team in my business OS. Here, I'm working with my HR team, GPT Express Mastery. And here, I'm working with my content team. It's like I'm a CEO with multiple teams, multiple departments, and I can distribute work and they can all work in parallel. I can run some stuff with my operational team. Then in parallel, I can run stuff with my HR team. And then in parallel, I can work on some stuff with my content team. Now, if I check in my content team, actually we have several sessions. So my content team is working on several stuff in parallel. Same here. If I check my operational team, I have several sessions in parallel. When I work like this, I'm really a CEO with multiple teams, multiple departments. I distribute work. They do their stuff in parallel. I check what they're doing. I give them feedback. I give them direction. And that's the way we can really have super high leverage in what we do. I want to insist how powerful it is to have self-orchestrated sub-agents by Cloud Code and the capability of Cloud Code to invoke tools, to invoke sub-agents, to invoke skills, and for tools and sub-agents to invoke them in parallel.
[31:45] So far, we've seen different capabilities that Cloud Code has. But what if you need to connect Cloud Code with external services? For instance, APIs. That's the next one. The cool stuff with Cloud Code is that you can connect your environment with external tools. OK, so far in the course, we've covered internal tools, internal features that Cloud Code has. Now let's talk about external tools. So first, API. Don't be afraid. That's really simple. An API is just an interface that allows software to discuss with each other. And usually what you do, if you have an external tool you want to work with, you check if they have an API. And then you check the documentation of this API. You put it inside Cloud Code. You explain what you want to do. In Cloud Code, we figure out how to discuss with this external tool. Because once again, an API is just an interface that allows programs to discuss together. And in an API, you have endpoints, which are internet addresses. And when you want to work with an API, you just find the right endpoints, the right internet address you want to use. And then you send authentication. You send a formatted message to this address. And then the tool, external tool does its stuff and then gives you back an answer. And that's as simple as that.
[33:15] So a typical use case is when you want to connect your Cloud Code with email, like Gmail, Google Docs, or to your CRM to add data or pull data from your CRM or post to social media. Every social media platform has an API, which is, once again, an interface that you can discuss programmatically with. Or if you want to fetch data from a database, you will use the API of the database tool. You want to work with an external tool, find the API you need. And if I go, for instance, if I take the example of Gamma, which is the API I'm using to create presentation automatically. So you can see in my business OS, I have some files related to Gamma API. Let's suppose I want to connect to Notion. Never done that before. But I could ask Cloud Code to, hey, find the documentation of the Notion API so that I can create notes in my Notion account and I can pull data from my Notion account. OK, as simple as this. And then Cloud Code will just make some web research to find the API documentation. Hopefully it won't be too long. Fetch it, so read it. And then once again, remember, authentication, then sending formatted message, then receiving answers and doing your stuff with the answer. So here, basically, what I would need to do is to get my API key from Notion, put it in a .nv file that is here where I put all my credentials. And then Cloud Code will write the script according to what I need to do. Of course, I can make that evolve. And if I just explain in plain English what I want, Cloud Code, knowing the Notion API documentation, can just translate what I want into, OK, what are the URL in the Notion API we need to work with? What's the format of the data? What's the protocol to authenticate? And then it will manage that and create the script that allows me to do this. Of course, I would test that and so on. But that's as simple as that. According to the API and how well they are built, and it depends on the external tool, you may take some time to make it work. But basically with Cloud Code, you don't need any coding skills, which means once you know an API you want to work with, once you get API keys or whatever is necessary to authenticate with this API, you're good to go. You can create a bridge and then you can get this external tool working with your environment.
[35:40] OK, if you see here, it's looking for the right format to discuss with the Notion API. I will stop there because actually I'm not using Notion. For me, Notion is a distraction, but I know that many people like Notion, so that would be a simple manner to connect Notion to your Cloud Code environment. OK, you can see here authentication, the API basics here, and then here it's documenting how to create a page or a note in Notion programmatically. We don't care about this. That's the format, OK, of the message we should post, which means send to the Notion API URL to create a page. OK, that's the type of format that we need to send. An example, if you want to retrieve something from Notion, we send that to the right endpoint, the right URL, which is database. Can you see here? The URL was a page. Here it's database. And then, of course, database ID, which is the identification of the database you want to pull information from. And that's it. And so now here, would you like me to create a complete Python or JavaScript script for a specific use case? I could say yes. I will stop there because once again, I'm not using Notion. But just to show you that you don't need to be a coder and the concept is pretty simple. API, once again, it's an external interface you can use to programmatically connect with an external tool. And that is just URLs. And you send message to this URL. You get answers. OK, you send message, which are requests on the URL. The external tool does its stuff based on the message you send. The only thing is that the message needs to be properly formatted. The authentication must be properly handled, most of the time with API keys. And then once the tool has done its job, it gives you back whatever results you needed. And then you can process it inside your cloud code. Very simple.
[37:30] OK, so advantages. And we can stop copy-pasting between tools. And look, we don't need AI workflows. We don't need Zapier. We don't need Mac.com. We don't need all that any longer. We can do it like side notes. The only use case when you need a Mac.com or a Zapier or a N8n is when you want an automation to be triggered whenever, when you're not in front of your computer and when you're not working. If you want background automation, yes, these scenarios are useful. Why? Because cloud code works only when your computer is alive and when you're working on your computer. But in my case, I have very few use cases where I need this workflow automation. And most of the time, if I need them, it's super simple. Anyways, so when you have an external tool that you're using, be it Notion, Figma, Miro, whatever, your CRM, Rtable and so on, they all have API and they all have API documentation. And so you can make research with cloud code to find the API documentation and make cloud code ingest the API documentation and then create whatever bridge you want with these external tools. That works great. This being said, there is a new protocol that makes working with external tool theoretically easier. And these are MCPs. It's worth having a look at this because it's a very promising standard and might probably be the best way to connect with external tool in the future. It's still in development, so it's not perfect, but let's have a look at this.
[39:00] MCPs are a standardized manner for AI agents to communicate with external tools. It's a protocol that helps your agent understand what are the tools available in an external app and call this tool properly. In MCPs, you can have also additional stuff, like you can have prompts and stuff like this, but hey, let's keep it simple. So think MCPs as a power adapter for different countries, different tools. Cloud code is the device, the services are the countries or the tools, and the MCPs is the standardized adapter. Okay, so that's an easy manner to connect cloud, cloud code or any AI agent to external tools. So there is lots of hype around MCPs because MCPs bring official plugins, pre-made toolbox for a given external app that your agent immediately understands and can tap into and use, right? That's the theory. Everything being standardized, that means it's easy to develop MCPs and also it's easy for any AI agent or cloud code to use an MCPs. It knows the standard, it knows how to identify the tools that are available, it knows how to use the tools and then apply the tools, the external app, right? And normally it's auto-integrate, which means cloud code is able to understand what tools it needs, look for the right tools, then use it and that's it, okay? So you don't even need normally to request for the use of the tool, even if it's always better to enforce it to be sure that everything is done fine, okay? But the reality is that it's a new technology, so there's big hype, but it still needs maturity. I've seen many MCPs popped up with big claims and actually they are crap. Why? Because they are poorly developed, they are not stable, or you can install them in an easy manner on some AI agent, like in cloud, but not necessarily in cloud code, like that's a mess. And even when you use them, actually they're not necessarily fulfilling the promises. So if I were you, I would only use official MCPs that are supported by the community and that are well documented and up to date, obviously for reliability issues. I will be very cautious with open source MCPs. Why? Because you don't know the quality of them, you don't know if they are up to date, you don't know if they are well documented, that's really tricky. Theoretically, you can create your own custom MCPs because MCPs is just a protocol that ends up making it easier to connect your cloud code or your AI agents with external tools. Easier than having to do it manually, understanding the APIs and creating scripts to make API calls. But at the end of the day, this is packaged API calls, right? Just it helps AI agents to automatically understand what are the tools so that they can invoke them automatically without you doing nothing and understand immediately what are the set of tools and points that are available and how to use them. Okay, so it's really a protocol to make life easier for AI agents and leverage AI to use external tools properly according to context. That's at the end of the day, it's a packaging. This is why it's a communication protocol. So once you use MCP, use MCP when you have a proven, official, ideally MCP for an app, an external tool you want to plug on your cloud code or AI agent system. If no MCP exists, I advise you, or if you can just find some crappy open source MCPs, I advise you to use API scripts, the thing we've seen just before. Same if you need custom logic or specific use of external tool, use API scripts. Let me show you how to install MCP and what it looks like.
[42:45] Okay, so I like this GitHub repo, model context protocol, which is what MCP means, slash servers. Why? Because it's an official one. You have lots of MCPs here. Let's pick one. We'll pick Playwright, which is a Microsoft MCP. It's a browser automation MCP that uses Playwright to run tests, navigate pages, capture screenshots, create content, automate web interaction reliably. Pretty much giving your cloud code, if you're using cloud code, access to internet and visualizing web pages and working with web pages. So that's pretty cool, right? So if I click there, I go in this page here, and here I have the information about the MCPs. But since we are not coders, we won't check that. But just here, quick review here, 23k stars. That means lots of people are using that and rated it. Here you have the releases. The latest one is this one. It was released yesterday, which means it's an MCP that is actively worked on and updated, right? Many contributors, etc. It's a really good indication that the MCP is actually legit. And so if you want to install your MCP in code, you can either ask Cloud Code directly. Hey, I want to use this MCP, do it. What I like to do is I like to check that there are something in the MCP that is perfect to install in Cloud Code. They have implemented quick installation for Cloud Code. And so here, that means if we want to use it in Cloud Code, we just need to use that, that line here in Cloud Code. So let's go back in Cloud Code here. OK, we paste it. I can say I will give some context. Hey, I want to install globally the Playwright MCP and then validate. And so it will execute the command and that's it. It's installed. It's as easy as that. When you want to install validated MCPs, legit one, it's pretty straightforward. Now, I've seen myself struggling a lot with some underground MCPs, so I don't recommend to spend too much time on that. OK, so now I have my Playwright MCP that has been successfully installed globally. And so it's added to the cloud configuration. I should find it in this folder if I want to check. Let's keep things simple. And then it can automate web browsers, create dynamic web content, test web application, interact with web page programmatically. This one is really good when you're developing a new one, by the way. And so it's normally available globally. So I will log that. Yes, let's do the three steps. By the way, in the meantime, I use the command slash mcp. I can check MCP status and I can see, hey, Playwright is connected, whatever. And if I use the MCP, manage MCPs, now I need to continue in the terminal. It's no big deal. And so it will open cloud code in my terminal, whatever. And now I have MCP. And so you can see here, Playwright is connected. If I click on it, I can configure it. OK, so that's my Playwright MCP server. It's connected. And there are 21 tools. And you can see in this Playwright MCP, there are 21 tools. Let's see what is in there. You can see there are many tools, upload files, fill form, install browser specified in the config, press key, navigate. Basically, all these tools are actions that my agent, my cloud code, can do on a web interface to navigate it through the Playwright. OK, so nothing big here, just I wanted to show you how to install a MCP really quick and how to check that everything is running fine and how to check what kind of tool your cloud code has access to through this MCP. OK, so no big deal here. Let's remove that. Oh, let's clean that properly.
[47:00] We've covered a lot. Now let me show you how all these pieces fit together into a complete system. Let's make a quick recap. So we've seen that with cloud code, you have several features and also several capabilities that make it a complete AI-powered system, especially in a business context. Once again, cloud code has been highly pushed for developers and coding use cases, but actually we are using it for business, and it's amazing. In cloud code, we have basically all folder structures which represent all different projects or tasks or teams according the way you want to call that. I call that either project or my teams. And we have cloud.nd file that gives for each project, each team, each folder, instructions, mechanism, way of doing stuff inside the project, which means each time cloud code is called, it checks the cloud.nd files and it knows everything about the current work inside this project. So you can consider that as the business brain and the way your business or your business operating system is structured. Then you have your sub-agent teams that can be available globally or locally at project level, and I consider that as my different department, my teams working for me. And they are self-requested by cloud code. And there are many manners to do this, but let's not enter into the details. Then you have tools that you don't necessarily see internal tools. For instance, cloud code has tools to read files, to do web search and so on. Let's not take too much time on this. Let's keep things simple. Cloud code manage, I mean, use the right tools at the right moment without you doing nothing. So it's kind of working in the background. Then you have the skills, which are reusable workflows that are packaged and they can be shared between your teams of sub-agents or even between other users, like your teammates or your customers. Or exactly what I'm doing in CCTG, I'm sharing skills, some skills with you guys. And so all that for their structure, cloud.md files, sub-agent teams, skills, tools inside cloud code. These are internal capabilities. On top of that, you have also the possibility to add external capabilities, external tools through APIs and MCPs. So you could build your own system, trying to understand how to use all that and then do trial and errors and so on. But there is so much value to having pre-built systems so that you don't build from scratch. You don't spend months of work on just building the stuff, designing the folder structure, writing the cloud.md files, creating the sub-agents, testing them, improving them, removing the ones that are not working well, or building skills library, which takes time because each time you're building a skill, you need to test it, you need to improve it. That's work, right? Or setting up integration, testing API connection, testing MCPs. And you could do this and spend lots of time doing this. Or you could deploy mine, the entire business OS with folder structure, cloud.md files, mechanism already built in. As well as my content team with the 14 sub-agents that I have in Magnetic Content OS, the strategy console, the AI Growth Engine plugin, which is yours. That would be the AI Growth Engine with its framework, its structure, but applied to your business. With the productivity system, with the daily planning, productivity assessment already built in, taking your information, what you work on with Cloud Code on a daily basis to give you assessment about your productivity, to help you also prioritize using the Brutal Prioritization framework on the right stuff for your business. Having AI support to be productive and focused, of course, would have also my HR team, the GPT creation team, the GPT Express Mastery OS, and skills and scripts library that I developed for myself, only focusing on stuff that are useful for business, of course. You can have access to all this here in the Cloud Code OS. This is what I'm sharing in Cloud Code OS. I'm sharing my systems, my teams, that you can deploy that right away inside your own business and leverage this full system. And of course, you're not alone with just the system. I'm here through implementation calls to help you customize it or make it evolve as you see fit based on your need inside your business. And so that's the power of this Cloud Code OS program. And so this program is definitely the fastest path for you if you want to have a fully integrated AI powered business operating system that helps you work on what matters inside your business with the right tool, leverage in a maximum manner the latest AI approach. I'm using these systems daily for my own business, which means I update them, I improve them. And of course, all these improvements and updates are transferred to you in the Cloud Code OS. It's not a static product. It's a living, evolving system that is driven by my conception of the business, which is all about focus, prioritizing the right stuff inside the business, solving the immediate bottleneck and improving the aspect of the business that I call attract, attract the right customers, convert, convert the right customers, retain them, ensure that they are satisfied with the service, delivering outstanding service and ascend them, like selling them more stuff. I build everything around this, like the right focus and maximizing the attract, convert, retain, ascend function or dimension of the business. So we'll talk more at the end about this, but first let me show you how Cloud Code itself operates because understanding this gives you more control. And here in the next part, I will show you some ways to use Cloud Code in a better manner.
[52:50] The cool stuff to do with Cloud Code is use the plan mode. With the plan mode, you basically ask Cloud Code to think about what you ask it to do and it will write a plan. And also you can use natural language command like sync hard, sync harder or hook tracing to really push Cloud Code to use more token and think more about whatever problems you have asked it to solve or whatever task you want it to do. And so this plan mode is a read-only architect mode. To activate it, I will show you, you can use shift tab or you can click on the right part of the interface. Then Cloud Code will analyze and propose the plan. You read the plan, you approve before execution. For huge tasks or huge work I have to do with Cloud Code, I always use the plan mode so that I can review its approach, I can correct it. And sometimes I can better understand also how to implement a given task or a given project. And then I approve and then it executes. It writes the to-dos. You've seen that there is a tool that Cloud Code calls often, which is to-do list that helps it be aligned with what it needs to do and not forget things. And so really the plan mode is super powerful. And I really recommend that you use it each time you're working on significant projects so that you have architect Cloud Code mapping the plan, suggesting the plan and then you can validate. And it gives you also the blueprint of what would be done and so that you have no surprise when Cloud Code implements. The advantage of it, of course, it's safety and control. It's also helping you to better think about a given project or given thing you want to implement with Cloud Code and that's super useful, right? It ensures that you have a structured approach. You know, back in the day when we were working with just prompt or even with just custom GPTs, we used to say, and that's a prompting technique, proceed step by step, explain to me what you will do first so that I can validate and so on. Here, it's same idea, but automatically done by Cloud Code in an optimal manner. So let me show you what plan modes look like. OK, to activate plan mode, you can use here, this ticking here. You can shift to plan mode. You can use shift tab as well and it will change it. And then I don't have any example here. I'd like to know how I can best explain to CCGG member the power of Cloud Code OS program and what is the value they would get from it and what they would avoid, what's the pain they will avoid by implementing it and what's the huge benefits they will get if they implement it. Can you help me with that? OK, in here, I want to use plan mode so that Cloud Code can think about it, find some resources inside my CCGG Business OS and give me a plan to explain that to you, obviously. So you can see now it's collecting information. Yes, don't ask again. And here, the cool stuff is that Cloud Code won't implement anything. If we just collect information, process that and then come up with a plan based on my request. So here it's gathering context and so on. You can see it has found information about Cloud Code Business OS value proposition and now it's compiling findings into a clear organized response for me, the plan. So now it's the plan following my query here. So Cloud Code Business OS complete value proposition framework, the transformation from ChatGPT chat session to Cloud Code Business OS with integrated system that knows your entire business, persistent memory, strategic partner, automated operations and intelligence. Point point, they will avoid money, where was I, friction. Strategic drift, weeks lost on low value work. What should I work on? Paralysis, decision fatigue daily. Inconsistent productivity with no pattern visibility. You cannot analyze your work. Manual tracking hover. OK, here we automate tracking. Blocked without knowing what's blocking you. Hidden dependencies. Huge benefits that we get. Time freedom, strategic certainty, compounding intelligence, execution clarity, productivity optimization, project continuity, strategic leverage, plus seven integrated workflows. You have the daily operating system. You have the strategic layer, the AI growth engine. You have the infrastructure layer with project lifecycle, workflow, system maintenance, different proof points, implementation path. You can start with the basic feature and work with the strategic feature and then use the complete system. Positioning for CCG members and key messaging by avatars, simple pitch structure, files ready for you to use. OK, so that's the plan. And then I can say, yes, would you like me to create a specific deliverable using this framework, including YouTube scripts, sales page copy, workshop, etc. So it's going beyond what I asked. But here I have a plan. It has gathered information, processed it, and then suggest me a plan with the different elements I could use and then told me about the resources, possibly implementation. So that's a simple example of how to use plan mode. Now I can shift back to normal mode or I can just say execute and then it will execute. The plan mode is super powerful to plan your work and be sure that cloud can structure your approach and execute it in a sound manner.
[58:20] Now let's talk about configuration control. I will cover here, the next part will cover settings versus instructions. Let's roll. Here what I want to cover quickly is settings.json and cloud.md file. We have already covered cloud.md file. But there is another file which is settings.json. And this is the way it looks like in my CCDG Business OS. I have a settings.json here and actually in the settings.json you can set up environment variables. Of course, you can use code code to do it for you. But just I want to show you what is inside. A set of variables, some specific rules that you want to use at the project level here. That can be at the full system level if you go in your user.cloud subfolder because in there see the very same settings.json. Basically the settings.json is in any project you have inside cloud code. Let me show you that. OK, in my root folder, my system root folder, I have also settings.json. There is nothing in there. Why? Because I don't work globally. I work only in my CCDG Business operation in this CCDG Business operation folder. So here in my settings.json, my global settings.json, there is nothing. OK, in addition to variables and specific rules, you have also permissions and deny. You can see, for instance, I don't want anything from this project to write in my AI Growth Engine knowledge base. OK, why? Because I want to keep the knowledge base untouched when I'm working actively on operations. The thing you need to understand is they add some layer of automation in your cloud code systems. You have an hierarchy of settings.json. You have the settings.local.json that will work on your local project only for you. That's the one that will be taken into account first. Then if you don't have that one, you have the settings.json that works at the project level, but that can be used by other users as well if they have access to your project. And then you have the general one that I showed you before, which is this one here in the .cloud subfolder of the root user folder. And this is a settings.json that works globally, but it's the weakest. That's the one that will be used the last only if there is nothing else in the previous one. Just the thing to understand is that the settings.json set machine readable controls in a JSON format that gives tools permission, model selection, hooks, environment variables, NCPs and so on. Most of the time, you don't need to take care about this, even if you can use it to enforce permission or authorization and so on. But really in a business context, most likely you won't pay too much attention to that. But I want to mention it anyways. And you have the cloud.nd files, which is human readable. So that's good for you to understand also what is done in a given project. And that, of course, is exploited by Cloud Code also to have context when it's starting a new session inside a project or inside a team or inside a department or inside a folder. For me, folder on your machine can correspond to a specific project, to a specific team and workflows or a specific department, like I call them. Department like in a company. You have your department with your teams, your subagents and all that sit inside a folder that can have a cloud.nd file that gives context and instructions and a settings.json that gives some consideration elements and permissions. They work together. You don't need to pay too much attention to the settings.json. I've spent, I mean, I've worked hundreds of hours with my Cloud Code and I barely pay attention to that one. The cloud.nd file is the most important, in my opinion, from my experience.
[1:02:15] Now, can you have tools everywhere and tools only for specific projects? Yes, that's the notion of hierarchy. I already covered that a bit when explaining the settings.json. Maybe I did a poor job explaining this to you. So I hope you're not confused. But let's try to clarify this notion. OK, let's talk about hierarchies, settings hierarchy from the highest to the lowest. So that's what I've tried to explain like a few minutes ago. You have local project settings. In the .cloudsettings.local.json, that's your personal tweak. It won't be available for other teammates. It won't be available on GitHub if you have synchronized what you do on Cloud Code with GitHub. Then you have shared project settings in the .cloudsettings.json. And all these .cloud subfolders are available in all folders you're working on with Cloud Code, right? It's everywhere. Every project or department or teams or workflows you're working on inside a folder on your computer, there is a .cloud subfolder and they have settings.local.json. Most of the time, there's nothing in there. Side note here. OK, so the two first layers, local project, shared project. You can see in the shared project, actually, it's checked on Git. So it can be used by other teammates who have access to the same project if you share a project. And then you have the personal global settings in your user folder, subfolder.cloud and file is settings.json. And that's your preferences, the personal everywhere. An analogy to understand that is that you can have a personal toothbox and that's what is in the .cloud subfolder of your root user folder. So that's the tools you carry everywhere personally. Then you have team workshops inside your project in the .cloud subfolder of a project folder. And then you have your personal tweaks, which is the settings.local.json. OK, the settings merge. They are not replaced, but with another priority and the higher priority of a rise is specified. And from what I've experienced and understood, this one for you has more priorities as this one that has more priority this one. This logic of hierarchy is true for other objects inside Cloud Code. For agents, for instance, you can have agents in a specific folder. You can have agents in your .cloud subfolder of your user root folder. And if they are just local, they are applied to the project. Only if they are in the .cloud subfolder of the user root folder, they apply everywhere. Same for skills. I know that like currently, November 2025, there are some issues about the capacity to invoke skills that are locally implemented. This being said, that's a detail. It has not prevented me from doing what I wanted to do. So it's a detail, but I mentioned it. OK, key mechanism, automatic discovery. So when Cloud Code works, it scans folders. And so you don't have to say anything to Cloud Code. It will just scan the folder and see what is available in the settings.json files. And the same with Cloud.md files, by the way. Some elements like skills are auto activated. And once again, skills can be in your user folder. It can be in the project folder, right? Normally, they are automatically invoked by Cloud Code. Sometimes I recommend you to enforce the invocation by Cloud Code, by mentioning that you wanted to use the skill. That is the safe path, I would say. There is another thing that I've shown you previously without mentioning too much about this, is command. When you use the slash key, if I go there, you have access to command. You can see here, you can navigate to different commands and you have the slash command here. OK, like compat, content formatter and so on. To be honest, I rarely use the command, but this is your way also to trigger specific command manually without relying on Cloud Code to invoke automatically skills or other stuff like this. So the difference I see with skills and command is that skills can be auto invoked, whereas command, it's you ask Cloud Code to do specifically something using a command. And I will tell you more about command in a few minutes. And so this hierarchy of settings.json, but also on skills, on agents, helps you to contain this object or this feature at different level, either just for you personally or globally on your system with other people having access to part of your project, for instance.
[1:06:20] I've tried to cover configuration control, control. This being said, most of this, I told you that so that you understand and you know that it exists. But really, when you're using your system, when you're using Cloud Code, you don't need to manage that too much, especially if you're using it solo. Now, if you're using with other teammates, that's another story. Now, how can you try what Cloud Code does? Let's talk about logging. Let's cover logging and tracking. So in Cloud Code, you have building Cloud Code logging stuff. Cloud Code tracks tool usage. It logs error and it keeps session history. So if you open a Cloud Code session, I already showed you that. But if I open a, if I check this one, for instance, here you can see I have my session history and I can open one and I will go on with what I did in this given session. OK, so that means you can reuse sessions. So Cloud Code is keeping history and logging stuff. But that's not enough. Why? Because it's mostly technical stuff or just chat sessions. I've implemented my own custom business logging logic using several mechanisms, logging different operations in a structured manner, integrating that with different other workflows and processes. This is not part of Cloud Code by default. This is part of Cloud Code OS and this is something you can access to in the Cloud Code OS program. OK, I'm continuously improving this because what I want to do with the right logging system, I want to be able to track the work that has been done to do some analysis over time about the work that is done, about alignment of strategic priorities and many, many other stuff for which logging what you do in a structured manner and clever manner is super useful. Really here we are leveraging if you have the right systems and you will have when you join Cloud Code OS, you can really take another step in terms of tracking your work, planning your work, analyzing your work, understanding what happened, if there is any derail or issues and many, many other stuff. Understanding what teams are doing, teams or project or workflow inside Cloud Code are doing, understanding how to improve that, doing some improvement analysis, like the sky is the limit. This is what you would like to have in your normal business with your teammates. OK, except here you don't need them. It's automated and it's well structured and you can process cross project, cross team, across time analysis and so on. You have a real business journal optimized for business perspective, for business objectives and for business use. You can flip back anytime, you can track your progress, you can analyze patterns, like that's so powerful. And that's where real business values sit with such a system as the Cloud Code OS. Because now you know exactly what Cloud Code has worked on, but also what you are, your teammates, if you put them in the system, have worked on. You can spot patterns, you can check efficiency of workflows, you can find bottlenecks, you can find productivity derail, you can find like many stuff. You can do audit trail for compliance, you can use it for continuous improvement. And the cool stuff is that all this is done automatically and that's super powerful. If I show you an example, for instance, if I check yesterday, I did a productivity assessment. So you can see here, I can come back to the right transition and that's my productivity assessment. And look what it has spotted. Pattern identified. Infrastructure building crowds out execution for two consecutive days. Why? Because I had set business priorities I should have worked on last Saturday. And actually I spent some time creating what it calls infrastructure, which are basically systems. Instead of working on the business priorities, I worked on infrastructure. And so it has spotted this because obviously I haven't been able to address some priorities I needed to work on. And it's analyzed why I did that and did some recommendation, which is A, it's okay to work on infrastructure, but do it after the one thing, after working on the main topics you have planned for the day. And it was able to do this because it tracked everything I do. And it understands the strategic environment, strategic, how to say that, priorities. And also the different projects I'm working on, the different tasks I'm working on. Okay, you can see the power of it. That's crazy.
[1:10:45] Anyway, sometimes you want to trigger specific workflows manually. And so that's when you use custom commands. So we have already covered really quickly custom commands in the previous chapter, but let's take a closer look to this. You already have pre-built commands in Cloud Code. And I already showed you this. If you type slash, you have pre-built commands, all that, okay. But you can also set up your own commands, which are basically workflows and processes, simple processes that you can trigger manually so that Cloud Code executes them. And so what are custom commands? They are user-initiated multi-step workflows. They are stored in, once again, in a .cloud folder, in a subfolder that is commands, and you can invoke them just using the command name. Some analogy, it's a bit like a macro in Excel or a shortcut on your phone. It's just a sequence of operations that you can trigger anytime. And the difference between skills and commands, because that might be a question you have, is that skills are auto-invoked by Cloud. They're automatic, context-based, which means Cloud Code understands the context and identifies the skills that match the context, and then will use the skills and use progressive disclosure, go deeper if necessary, take some resources that are inside the skills, maybe a script that is inside the skills, and execute. Whereas custom commands, it's you invoke manually and trigger explicitly something that Cloud Code has to do. And so typically, it's very useful for recurring workflows. For instance, if you want to do weekly planning, you can have a custom command to do this. It's also useful for complex sequences, when you have multi-step processes to do, and when you want to standardize process and trigger them manually with full control. And so how you can create that command, custom command, you use Cloud Code and you ask for a custom command, okay? You explain what you want and Cloud Code will help you create the custom command. And basically what Cloud Code will do, it will create a file that we put in the .cloud slash commands subfolder. Once it's done, you just call the custom command with the slash and the name of the command. Okay, and if I show you what a custom command looks like, let me find one for you. In my ccgg business operation, in my .cloud folder, I have here a command, which is init business. And you can see, like skills, like sub-agents, it's a markdown file, a .md file, with a YAML header metadata with a description. And this is what this command does. It's initialize business project cloud.md with business specific guidance. It has some tools. It can use read, write, edit globe, which are the basic tools of Cloud Code. And then just the md file instruct what Cloud Code should do when I trigger this command, init business. It's a custom command I have created so that I have Cloud Code creating a project infrastructure with a cloud.md file that is specifically structured for what I want to do. So I want Cloud Code to do something in a specific manner and I want to trigger it manually. I use a custom command.
[1:13:50] Enough with commands. Now, how about syncing Cloud's work with external systems? Interesting, right? So let's talk about GitHub and how to do backup, version control and collaboration. So GitHub is really for coders, but guess what? We are using Cloud Code, not for code. We are not developers. We are just normal people, entrepreneurs who have businesses and want to leverage the power of AI to run our business in a lean, effective and focused manner so that we can get free, right? OK, so I'm using GitHub for a different purpose, to backup the work I do inside my business OS, of course, to control the version, to be able to revert back in a more automated manner if need be, and also to sometimes collaborate with other people, right? So what is GitHub? Quickly, it's kind of a drop box for code with time travel. So you can backup stuff, you can control version, you can collaborate, you can time travel. That means you can revert back what you did. And there are lots of many other stuff, but for our purpose, that's the main stuff to understand, the main features of GitHub to understand. There are many other stuff you can do for GitHub. It's a very powerful tool for coders. But for us, it's good enough. You can work in parallel and test different approach in parallel to check the ones you prefer and then merge the one you prefer on the main projects. You can do so many stuff, whatever. The advantage is for business is that you can recover for any issues. That's a backup, OK? Which means you can also use your system on another computer if need be. Why? Like, let's suppose that your computer is dying because one of the problems with code is that you work on local files, right? And what if you have a virus or what if your computer is dying? Now you're screwed. Not any longer if you have a backup system on GitHub because now you can open another computer, inside your GitHub account, import everything inside your new installation and you're good to go. You can also control the version history so you can see the system evolution. You can collaborate with other people, experiment safely. You can audit stuff, understand who work on what and who change what. If you have several people working on the same Cloud Code business OS and it gives you remote access because you can access from any machine as well. And so how it works, you ask Cloud Code to create a GitHub repo. You connect Cloud Code to GitHub. It's something you do once. And then if you give access to Cloud Code to the GitHub CLI, which is some sort of module, Cloud Code is able to create whatever repo in your GitHub account. And so that makes stuff way easier. And then of course, Cloud Code can commit changes, which mean push changes on your GitHub repo and commit them so that now they are alive. You can also synchronize between your local Cloud Code business OS and what is inside GitHub. You can Cloud Revert, collaborate anytime. That's super powerful. That's really easy to set up. You ask Cloud Code and at some point it will ask you to connect to GitHub with your authentication method. You do this, you accept connection, you accept the synchronization, the connection between Cloud Code and GitHub and you're good to go. That's really straightforward.
[1:16:40] Let me bring it all together because we have covered many things here. And let me show you what's next. So we have covered a lot. We have covered file-based memory and system prompt with cloud.md files. We have covered sub-agents organized as teams that allows you sequential or parallel execution, having the sub-agent auto-orchestrated by Cloud Code. We have covered skills with our reusable workflows, which are standard operating procedures that you can equip your Cloud Code system with or that you can also equip your teammates using Cloud Code with so that you can enforce SOPs at the company level. We have covered parallel execution, whereas it is with sub-agents working in parallel or tools that Cloud Code calls in parallel. We have covered access to external tools through API integration and MCPs. We have covered some feature that makes the work of Cloud Code more effective, like plan modes, some commands. We have covered the difference between settings with settings.json files that are more for machine reading and cloud.md instruction well-fit for you to understand what happens at the project level and also for Cloud Code to load context when it starts a new session in any project. We have talked about hierarchy, how you can organize skills, agents and settings.json files at different levels so that it can be used by only you locally on your machine, everybody working on a given project or globally on your system. We have covered logging mechanism quickly that is super useful for many business use cases like productivity assessment, planning, strategic alignment checking and many other stuff. We have covered custom commands quickly, how you can set up small automation or specific workflows that you can trigger manually, which is a bit different from skills where skills are triggered automatically, invoke automatically by Cloud Code. Custom commands helps you standardize some stuff you do and trigger them manually. And then we have covered backup and version control using GitHub in a very quick manner. So you can see that when you understand all these features, you have a complete system. But actually that's just step one, knowing the features, understanding how they work and where you can access them, it's only step one. Step two, it's implementing a cohesive system that combines all these features in a smart manner for a business context in order to increase business efficacy, in order to increase focus on what matters inside the business and in order to increase the power of execution of your business, leveraging AI-powered system the best manner. Of course, you can make your own trial and error and spend weeks, maybe months to try to set up the system or you can use a pre-made one. And that's exactly what I give you in Cloud Code OS inside CCGD community. In the Cloud Code OS, you have the entire business OS. That's the one I use for myself. So you can be sure that it's top-notch and I make it better consistently. When you have my business OS, you have the folder structure that is directly applicable to your business. You have the cloud.md files, which has the system prompts and a smart logic for the different folders and different projects. You have an already integrated mechanism for productivity, for planning, for cross-project analysis and so on. You have also my own teams, my department. You have my content team with the Magnetic Content OS that has more than 14 sub-agents to work on any type of content on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, etc. Working on hooks, working on thumbnails, working on all that stuff related to content. Applying the content framework that I teach also in CCGG. You have what I call my strategic console, which is the AI Gross Engine plugin with all the frameworks to really describe in a strategic manner your offer, your target avatar, your strategy, your funnels, your different products and so on. You have my productivity system with the daily planning, with the productivity assessment, with the logging systems to log the different projects, to log the different tasks, to log the different change that you do with Cloud Code inside your business environment. You have, of course, my HR department, what I call my HR department, which is the GPT creation team. The GPT Express Mastery OS that uses my GPT Express Mastery framework to craft custom GPTs, but also some agents, but at a superior level, way better than what you would do with just Cloud Code or just Cloud or just a chat GPT. Why? Because it's using a method that I've experimented with for more than two years and that I've taught to many people who just can tell you that it's a crazy good framework to craft superior custom GPTs and AI agents. But there is more. You will also have access to essential skills, like the skills factory, for instance, the skills to build other crazy good skills and other skills that I develop based on business use case and business needs. You also have some scripts library to connect with external tools and you just need to put your own API keys and you're good to go. And that would be much more because once again, this is the AI part business system to grow lean GPT business, a business that is optimized with lean processes to focus really on what matters to grow the business, implementing the best approaches to attract, convert, retain ascent customers without having to spend months to learn them. That would be much more. I will update this based on how I use the system and how other members in the Cloud Code OS are using the system to get results and also based on the new stuff that Entropiq will release for Cloud Code because guess what? Cloud Code is a big bet that Entropiq made. This is a tool they are investing massively to make better and there is so much great stuff that will come in the future and that will be updated inside Cloud Code OS. Here, the key difference is that you're not building anything from scratch. You can just take the resources I share with you. These are folders, basically, that you put on your computer and you're good to go. You open Cloud Code in your Visual Studio Code interface and you go in the right folder and good to go. Everything is there, already set up, right? So you can deploy in minutes what I've built, tested, and refined for days, weeks, months. If you're joining the Cloud Code OS program, you have my support through implementation, group calls that we do, and also you have access to me through DM, and so we can discuss about your specific case and I can help you tweak a bit the pre-made system that's already there and that you can deploy in minutes. It's a living system. I update it constantly and my updates are directly implemented in Cloud Code OS so that you can benefit from them. And of course, you may have some specific requests and if they all make sense, I can implement them as well, which means here we are leveraging Cloud Code OS, we are leveraging collective intelligence to make our business OS better with time. So finally, if you're a business owner, whereas you have an online business, whereas you're a coach, you're a service provider, you do consulting, or you need to create content, or you do product development, this is for you. If you want an AI team to handle execution inside your business so they can focus on strategy and you can just orchestrate your teams, your department as a CEO, that's for you because this Cloud Code OS is the business operating system that you can use right away to have these teams working for you and you can tweak it also with the support inside the community. And so if you want proven systems that are ready to deploy immediately, you can learn more about this in CCGG, MySQL community, and here in Cloud Code OS. This is the module where everything happens and where the resources to have your own AI-powered business OS inside Cloud Code are sitting, waiting for you. So I hope you enjoy this Cloud Code Mastery for Business course and I see you inside CCGG.

12. Optimization & Best Practices
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: AI Model Cost
TECHNIQUE: Use a paid Claude subscription rather than the Entropic API.
REASON: A flat subscription fee avoids paying per-token for AI mistakes or inefficient processing, which can become very expensive.
EVIDENCE: [07:00]
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: Task Complexity & Safety
TECHNIQUE: Use "Plan Mode" for significant or large-scale tasks.
REASON: It allows you to review, correct, and approve the AI's approach before it begins execution, preventing errors and ensuring the final output aligns with your intent.
EVIDENCE: [52:50]
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: Workflow Standardization
TECHNIQUE: Create "Skills" for recurring, multi-step processes (SOPs).
REASON: Skills are reusable, auto-invoked, and can be shared, ensuring that standard procedures are followed consistently across all projects and by all team members.
EVIDENCE: [19:40]
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: System Resilience & Recovery
TECHNIQUE: Use GitHub to back up and version control the entire Claude Code business OS.
REASON: Protects against data loss from hardware failure or viruses. Allows you to restore the entire system on a new machine and track all historical changes.
EVIDENCE: [1:13:50]
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: External Tool Integration
TECHNIQUE: Prefer official, well-maintained MCPs over undocumented open-source ones. If none exist, use API scripts.
REASON: Official MCPs are more reliable, stable, and up-to-date. Using poorly built MCPs leads to wasted time and frustration.
EVIDENCE: [41:15]
code
Code
OPTIMIZATION: Performance & Context Management
TECHNIQUE: Organize work into distinct folders with their own `cloud.md` files and use specialized sub-agents.
REASON: This isolates context, preventing the main context window from being polluted with irrelevant information and allowing agents to be highly specialized and effective.
EVIDENCE: [13:40]


### Video Transcribation:

If you think Cloud Code is just for developers, you're missing something huge. Cloud Code runs my entire business. And I'm not a developer.

This is not about coding. It's about business leverage. In this course, I will show you every feature and mechanism in Cloud Code that matters for business.

Not theory. Not fluff. Real tasks.

Real results. Cloud Code solves every limitation I've faced with JGPT, GMI, or even Standard Cloud. The memory problem.

The context problem. The scattered work problem. Gone.

I am Darren Wiener and I coach business owners in the world's first AI community. The AAA by Liam Otley. For the last three years, I've spent thousands of hours building systems with AI agents for real business scenarios.

Now, let's dive in. OK, let's start. Why are we stuck with JGPT and other AI tools? First problem is context window management issue.

We are limited by the context window. And the models, whatever the platform, Cloud, JGPT, GMI, take whatever platform, they all have the same problem. The models lose performance as the context fills.

There is loss of details. The models forget important stuff and at the end, hallucinate. Another big issue is the siloed sessions.

You cannot share context across chat sessions or across projects or between custom JGPTs in an easy manner. And it's a real problem when you're working on complex projects with different information scattered among different folders, different subprojects or different locations inside Cloud, JGPT and so on. Really, that's a huge limit.

Then there is another problem, which is the self-orchestration problems. In JGPT, you can use teams of custom JGPTs, but you have to call them manually using the add command. In Cloud, you cannot do this.

In Janina, you cannot use multiple teams in one chat session. And so in all those tools, you have to orchestrate manually, either with a command like in JGPT or copy-pasting stuff between chat sessions, between projects, between gems, between different chat sessions. And so that's painful.

Another thing that is painful with these tools is the connection with external tools. Let's face it, you can connect JGPT with connectors or Cloud with connectors in Cloud, but it's still very early and it's still basic. For instance, the Google Connector, the Google Drive Connector, Google Sheet and Google Docs Connectors, you cannot even have your custom JGPT or your Cloud project write Google Docs.

That's crazy. So it's useless for me. And in addition to that, even if you use the OpenAI schema with custom JGPTs inside JGPT, it's clunky, let's face it.

It's techy. It's not straightforward. I hate it.

And when you use it, it's really painful. You have to always authorize connection and so on. That's, wow, my God, that's so hard for nothing, right? So the capability to connect with external APIs is really limited.

Then you have all these other tools like N8n, Mac.com, Zapier, and so on, all these automation tools. And at the end of the day, when you want to do automated workflows, you need to combine all these tools. It's really techy.

Once again, it's brittle. Even if you don't pay any money, you will spend time. It's expensive to build, expensive to use, expensive to maintain.

And it becomes obsolete very fast. Think about it. OpenAI just released Agent Builder when I'm recording this video, which means tools like N8n or Mac.com, most likely, they can be threatened by that.

Who knows if N8n will still be something in six months? Not sure. I'm not making any prediction here because I don't know and anything can happen. But just to show you that these complex tools, you take time to learn them and then you have to learn something else because now it's not the best way to do stuff any longer.

Once again, what we do here is not technical. We want to use simple AI tools that are evergreen. Let's face it, if you work with just GPTs, it will last longer than working with specific AI tools.

And here, what I will show you, working with Cloud Code is definitely the future and it is there to stay for a very simple reason. Entropiq is investing massively on upgrading this tool, maintaining this tool, making it better, adding features, adding capabilities. So it's just the beginning, which means it's the right time to jump on trade.

And side note here, Cloud Code is initially a tool that is built for coders. But actually, you don't need to know any code to work with it. And in particular, with what I will show you, which means using Cloud Code inside Visual Studio Code and with the Cloud Code extensions, you will see it's like an experience that is quite close to a chatbot.

So you don't need any tech skills to use what I will show you. And the original thing that we do in CCGD and that I show you in this course is that we are using Cloud Code not for code, but for business-related work. Using AI agents, using processes, systems inside Cloud Code, leveraging the capabilities of Cloud Code, but for business purpose.

And that's really super powerful and super easy, actually. Once you have the right system, once you know how to use Cloud Code capabilities in a business context, that's pretty straightforward. So now let's see how to install Cloud Code in a few seconds.

It's very easy to install Cloud Code. I recommend to use Visual Studio Code. It's free.

And then to install Cloud Code extension. And then the only thing that remains to be done is authenticate with paid cloud subscription. And once again, I recommend you to use your paid cloud subscription rather than the API, because you can also use Cloud Code with the Entropic API.

But if you use the Entropic API, you will pay for every token you use. And I don't like this approach. Why? Because basically you're paying for mistakes that AI will do.

When AI consumes too much content, it's because AI is not effective enough to do the job in a limited amount of tokens. I don't want to pay attention to the number of tokens that the AI is using. So that's why I recommend to use a paid cloud subscription.

So let me show you how it looks. First, you go in Visual Studio Code. And here, you choose the right one for you.

I'm on Windows, so I would download the file here. And I would just execute it. And I would just follow instructions.

It's really straightforward. Then when you are in Visual Studio Code, you go in extension here. You look for Cloud Code.

And here you have Cloud Code for VS Code. You click on that, and then you can install it. For me, it's already installed.

So I won't do it. But you click install, and it will do everything alone. And the first time that you launch Cloud Code, and to launch Cloud Code, you just have to be in a folder.

So let's open a folder like this one, for instance. Once you're there, you just click on a file or somewhere. And you will see that here, you can launch with the upper right corner.

You can launch as many Cloud Code sessions as you want. And so the first time you connect with Cloud Code, before having this beautiful interface, you would have something that says, hey, authenticate. And then you can choose the method between API or between your Cloud subscription.

And I recommend to use the Cloud subscription. And it's pretty forward. You click on it.

It will open the browser. And then you just say, accept. I just read what is on screen.

Follow the process. It's really, really easy, straightforward. And you're good to go.

As easy as that. And you see, no coding, no nothing. It's pretty simple.

And you will see, Visual Studio Code is really simple, because it's a bit like Windows. You have folders with files. And you can navigate your computer there.

And then you have a bunch of features in Visual Studio Code. But that's not the point of this course to explain that to you. You will discover.

You will see it's pretty straightforward. Just a quick tip. You can see in a Cloud Code session here, I have access to the past conversation.

Here, I don't have any. But in a folder I have worked on, for instance, that one. Here, if I open another Cloud Code session, now I have past conversations.

OK, so that means I can find my past conversation if I need to. So pretty simple. That's it.

You now, you're ready. First thing to understand is the memory system. This is what we will cover next.

Yeah, when you first connect with Cloud Code, or sometimes when your access token has expired, Cloud Code will tell you that you need to log in again. And so you use the command slash login. And then you will end up on this screen.

And then that's where you can choose between Cloud AI subscription or Entropy Console, which is the API, or this. I've never used that. And so you click Cloud AI.

Then you have this box. You say yes. Then it opens this in your browser.

And then you just click authorize. And you're good to go. Then you go back to your interface, Cloud Code interface.

The cloud.md file, that's your business brain. Or that's the brain in more general context. That's the brain of Cloud Code.

The cloud.md file is a bit like a system prompt. And actually, you can have a cloud.md file in any folder you are working on with Cloud Code. This is some sort of permanent instruction files that you can use in each folder and for each project you're working on.

Really, it's like a system prompt. If you have worked with a chat GPT project, it's like the custom instruction for chat GPT product. Or if you have worked with custom GPTs, it's like the system prompt of a custom GPT.

And same for Cloud Project. If you've worked with Cloud Project, you have custom instructions for Cloud Project. So here, the cloud.md file is the same concept.

The thing to understand is that for each folder, you can have a cloud.md file. And so if you have a folder with subfolder and so on, you can basically have a hierarchy of project folder. And for each of them, you can have a cloud.md file.

And the cool stuff is that each time you open a Cloud Code session inside a folder, it will look for a cloud.md file to get instruction and context of what we were working on in this folder. In this course, I will call folder project. It's the same.

I will use the two words for the same concept. So obviously, the advantages of that is that you don't have to re-explain a project context or a business context. You can have different instructions per project or per folders.

You can compound the knowledge because each time you're working on a project, you can ask to update the cloud.md file so that the permanent memory or the system prompt, if you prefer, is always up to date. So it's super powerful. You can also use that to have some mechanism that Cloud Code will execute.

When it opens, you can, like, really the sky is the limit with this. Super effective. Cloud Code can help you design the cloud.md file, of course, but you can also decide and tell Cloud Code to put stuff you find important for a given project or given folder inside a cloud.md file.

So let's have a look at the cloud.md file. Here I am in my CCDG business operation. And if I open a project, for instance, this one, you can see here I have a cloud.md file.

And you can see here, this is the markdown file with information about the project, the scope, etc. Okay. And if I go in another subproject, for instance, this one, once again, I have a cloud.md file somewhere.

So now, cloud has memory and context with the cloud.md file. What if you need multiple AI teams working in parallel? That's where sub-agents come in. Sub-agents are AI workers inside Cloud Code.

The cool stuff with them is that they are specialized AI assistants. They have isolated context windows. Each context window has 200,000 tokens available to the date of this video.

That means you don't pollute the main context when you're working with agents. The cool stuff with agents is that Cloud Code can call them automatically, invoke them, and Cloud Code can run them in parallel or can run them sequentially according to the work they are doing. The sub-agents have access to the files in the folder you're working on, and so they can communicate with each other using the files they have access to, or Cloud Code can also pass context.

I've seen that Cloud Code can pass information from one agent to the other, sharing context. Okay, this is technical. It doesn't really matter.

Just Cloud Code can orchestrate automatically sub-agents, sharing context between the different agents, even if each sub-agent has its own context window. So the advantage is you can run multiple tasks at once. So you can go faster.

You can specialize them as well. So that can be a team of specialized sub-agents that work on the workflow, orchestrated by Cloud Code, not by you. You don't have to do it.

Of course, if you want to specifically ask Cloud Code to work with a given sub-agent, you can do it. No problem. But that's super useful.

And at the end, what a sub-agent is, it's a .md file. So let's look at this. This is my GPT Express Mastery team.

I call that my HR department. This is where I build all my sub-agents in Cloud Code and also where I build all my custom GPTs when I'm working on ChatGP. And so an agent is, you can see here in my HR team, I have several agents.

They correspond to my GPT Express Mastery framework, if you've watched the course inside CCGD community. And if I open one, this one, for instance, you can see that an agent has always the same metadata here. And in the metadata, I have the name, I have the description of the sub-agent, its mission.

That's what Cloud Code will use to know what the sub-agent does and also to invoke automatically the sub-agent if the task matches the description. You can specify the model. You can specify a color, especially if you're working on terminals, so you can see what agent is working.

And you can also specify the tool it has access to. It's optional, but you can do it. The classical procedure to create an agent in Cloud Code is using the command agents and here, configure agents.

I will have to continue in terminal because here I'm in the extension for Visual Studio Code. But if you want to make the slash agents come and work, you need to go into terminal. So if I go in the terminal, it looks like this.

And then I have the list of agents I have access to in my system. And if I want to create a new agent, I can just click here and then I can choose between project or personal. If I put my agent in project, that means the agent is available at the project level in the folder I'm working on.

If I put it in personal here, that means the agent will be available everywhere. That's a hierarchy of availability that is true for agents, for skills, for MCPs, all the key features of Cloud Code. You can either have them available globally or have them available locally.

I won't create any agents because once again, I don't use this approach to create agents. What I use to create agents is my HR team. And for instance, here I have my team working on an agent.

It's an example that I started just to show you. I just said, hey, I need an agent that can answer questions about Cloud Code for business. Then what did Cloud Code? It's refined my demand, or at least it identified inputs it needed and started answering the inputs automatically so that I can review.

I said, okay. And then what it did, it created a folder that is this GPT project, Cloud Code Business Expert. It's in there, Cloud Code Business Expert.

And then it called multiple agents to work on this sub-agent creation or this custom GPT creation. First, the purpose refiner that refined the purpose statement. And here it's a better definition of what the agent is meant to do, better than what I did initially.

And then you can see here that the to-dos of Cloud Code, using different sub-agents to work one after the other, executing my GPT Express Mastery Framework to craft custom GPTs. And then you can see a good example of parallel execution. So it's not sub-agents that are executing in parallel.

Here it's the web search tool that is used by Cloud Code in parallel. So that means Cloud Code is making these different queries in parallel to go faster. Okay, a bunch of query to collect knowledge.

And then it's fetching several URLs to collect knowledge, some other web search queries, and it's still making some research. Okay, and then after we'll craft the knowledge base and then the system prompt and then potentially some tools. And then I'm good.

I have my custom GPTs on my sub-agent ready to rock and roll. I call that my HR team. And this is something that is available in CCGG here in the Cloud Code OS so that you can plug it immediately, just copy paste it and have it available inside your Cloud Code environment without spending time setting this up.

It's already done and available in Cloud Code OS. So sub-agents handle complex tasks, but what if you need reusable workflows or standard SOP, standard operating procedure, that activate automatically and that Cloud Code can call in anywhere globally, which means these are standard way of working that you can use in any project anywhere in Cloud Code. That's skills.

Okay, consider skills as reusable workflows or standard operating procedure, which means when you know how to do something well and you want it to be done always the same time by Cloud Code, you will create a skill. And this skill can be called in any folder, in any project. So the key feature of skills is that Cloud can trigger them automatically, can use the skill automatically according to the work you ask it to do.

It will detect context match. Then skills are re-optimized for context window using a mechanism that is called progressive disclosure, which means when Cloud Code uses skills, it won't load the entire skills. It will just start discovering what the skill is about, reading the beginning of it, and then reading more if needed.

And that's really super useful for context window optimization. Another cool thing with skills is that skills mix deterministic code. You can put scripts inside skills and also knowledge files that can be processed by LLM, which means you combine both worlds.

Code for deterministic tasks and LLM for flexible AI automation or AI execution, let's call it. And finally, another stuff that is cool with skills is they are shareable, which means first and foremost, you can use them globally on your system in many different projects. You don't have to specify again.

They are available. And also you can package them and share them with other people, for instance, with your customers or for instance, with your teammates, which means you can enforce SOPs. You can ensure that your teammates using Cloud Code or your employees using Cloud Code will use the right SOP because you've shared a skill with them.

And guess what? In the Cloud Code OS, I'm sharing the skill I use for myself and I build for myself. I share them with you so that you can use them right away. It's copy pasting.

So simple. So like I told you, the advantage of skill is context window friendliness. And you know how much context window friendliness matters for a large language model performance.

They are reusable across projects globally anywhere from Cloud Code, except if you put the skill in one single folder, then they are available only on this folder. But if you put them globally, and this is what I advise you to do, if you put them in the .cloud subfolder in your user folder, they are available globally. Cloud decide automatically how to use them.

If you want to be ensured that Cloud use the right skill, you can also tell it to use the right skill. And the cool stuff is that you build once a skill and you can use it anywhere. And guess what? You can also improve the skill, right? So let me show you what a skill looks like.

Okay, here I'm in the .cloud folder in my user folder on Windows. And so that means everything that is there is globally available everywhere in my Cloud Code environment. Let's check skills factory.

Guess what? When Entropiq released skills a few weeks ago, three weeks ago now, the first thing I crafted is a skill to create other skills. Obvious. I did that in the past.

The first custom GPT I created, or maybe the third one I created is a custom GPT to create other custom GPTs. And back in the day, the first sophisticated prompt I created, it was what I used to call meta prompt, was a prompt to create other prompts. It was in February 2023.

Anyways, so this is how a skill looks like. A skill, as always, a skill.md5. Any skill has a skill.md5. You can see here, there is another one, etc. And so a skill.md5, as once again metadata, you will see that in Cloud Code, all files, all system files, let's call them that way, as always a metadata that helps Cloud Code understand what it is, what it does, when to invoke it, right? So here, same for skills.

We have a skill.md5 with this metadata, the name of the skill, the description of the skill, as simple as that. And then you have a description of the skill, what it does, the process inside. Basically, it's defined how Cloud Code should do the work when it's supplying these skills.

You can see it's a pretty short file, right? And if we check the outline of it, you can see in this specific one, if we check the outline of the skill.md5 for the skills factory, there is the metadata, there is a more extended description of what it does, there is a skill creation process, there is some troubleshooting, there is some reference documentation, and that's the progressive disclosure. When Cloud Code sees reference documentation, it sees how I have some other document I have access to. So potentially I can retrieve them, some example skills, some script, and some version history, okay? See it as a table of contents.

And then in the skill, I have some other documents. So that's knowledge about how to do the skills properly. And you can have also code.

Here I have some scripts. So these are Python scripts that Cloud Code will execute when it's using the script. I can give you an example about how skills are used.

For instance, I have a skill that is my standard operating procedure to create new projects inside my business OS. That's the project creator skill. And so let me show you how it looks like in real life.

If I am in my CCGG business operation system, so that's the one, let's create a project using a skill, okay? By the way, this operating system has many super useful processes, mechanism, and so on, that makes it super effective to run any aspect of my business. And guess what? It's available in Cloud Code OS so that you can copy-paste it with all the mechanism and the routine already set. And you can tweak them and make them specific for your own business.

And of course, the implementation calls inside Cloud Code OS are meant to help you customize it for your business. These implementation calls are group calls we do about each system I share inside Cloud Code. And it's also Q&A calls so that when you have questions about implementing your Cloud Code OS systems, I can help you.

Back in the main topic. So here, let me illustrate how to use skills. How a skill is used by Cloud Code.

So I will create a mock project so that I can show you the project creation skill to create the project the right way inside my CCGG business operation. So that would be a mock project just to show you how it works. Hey, use the right skill to create a project inside CCGG business operation.

That's a mock project just to demonstrate how you invoke skills to do stuff specifically here to create a mock project, right? Oh, that's a clunky ask I did here, but it should work. So here you can see it's calling the skill project creator and it's reading, it's discovering the skill. That's progressive disclosure.

Then the process is normally asking me some questions about the project. But here it has understood it's a mock demonstration. So it's just answering itself, following a procedure.

And then I say, yes, that's good. Let's go. And it will create it.

And so now it will follow the process to create the mock project as defined in the skill. So it will create project structure, generate the Cloud.md file, see Cloud.md file, what you should have in any project. A readme.md as well.

Then do some other stuff that are defined in the skill. OK, I will stop there. OK, if you have created anything, please clean that.

It was just an example. OK, thing to remember about skills, the progressive disclosure mechanism, the mix of deterministic script code, which is really reliable, and LLM that is more flexible. And you can mix that inside a skill if you want to ensure that the skill is used.

Normally Cloud.md code auto-invoke the skills, but sometimes it might just try to do it on its own, especially if it's simple tasks you're asking. So if you really want to enforce the skill, mention the skill when you ask Cloud.md code to do something. So definitely skills are super powerful individually.

But what if you run multiple skills and sub-agents at once? Call that parallel execution. Let's have a look. We already saw a bit how to do this with sub-agents or tool calls, like when I showed you web search in the previous example.

Let's talk a bit more about parallel execution. So the cool stuff in Cloud.md code is that you can execute in parallel either tool, either sub-agents and sometimes just Cloud.md code sessions. So the basic two approaches are multiple sub-agents in one session.

And in this case, Cloud.md code will invoke multiple sub-agents simultaneously to do a workflow. Once again, each agent will get an isolated context window but can share information. Either Cloud.md code gives different information to the different sub-agents to coordinate them, or you can use also files inside your folder that these agents have access to to refresh their context, share information, share their work.

The cool stuff is that Cloud.md orchestrates automatically. You cannot do this in Cloud or Gemini or these other AI tools. Cloud.md code here allows you to do it.

The other approach is to use multiple Cloud.md code chat sessions, which means you open several Cloud.md code windows inside the same folder or sometimes in different folders. And each session works on a different topic. Here, it's you who orchestrate and check what they do.

Something to understand, if you want to orchestrate multiple agents or if you want to have Cloud.md code orchestrating multiple agents, you can do it in parallel if there are no dependencies. If task A done by agent A doesn't need task B's output, and if they're working on different files, you want to avoid having two agents working on the same files at the same time in parallel because it's messy. So the advantage here obviously is massive time saving with parallel execution.

And really the way I see it is I'm the CEO and I distribute work among my teams. And so that's why most of the time I'm working with multiple departments. Here, I'm working with my operational team in my business OS.

Here, I'm working with my HR team, GPT Express Mastery. And here, I'm working with my content team. It's like I'm a CEO with multiple teams, multiple departments, and I can distribute work and they can all work in parallel.

I can run some stuff with my operational team. Then in parallel, I can run stuff with my HR team. And then in parallel, I can work on some stuff with my content team.

Now, if I check in my content team, actually we have several sessions. So my content team is working on several stuff in parallel. Same here.

If I check my operational team, I have several sessions in parallel. When I work like this, I'm really a CEO with multiple teams, multiple departments. I distribute work.

They do their stuff in parallel. I check what they're doing. I give them feedback.

I give them direction. And that's the way we can really have super high leverage in what we do. I want to insist how powerful it is to have self-orchestrated sub-agents by Cloud Code and the capability of Cloud Code to invoke tools, to invoke sub-agents, to invoke skills, and for tools and sub-agents to invoke them in parallel.

So far, we've seen different capabilities that Cloud Code has. But what if you need to connect Cloud Code with external services? For instance, APIs. That's the next one.

The cool stuff with Cloud Code is that you can connect your environment with external tools. OK, so far in the course, we've covered internal tools, internal features that Cloud Code has. Now let's talk about external tools.

So first, API. Don't be afraid. That's really simple.

An API is just an interface that allows software to discuss with each other. And usually what you do, if you have an external tool you want to work with, you check if they have an API. And then you check the documentation of this API.

You put it inside Cloud Code. You explain what you want to do. In Cloud Code, we figure out how to discuss with this external tool.

Because once again, an API is just an interface that allows programs to discuss together. And in an API, you have endpoints, which are internet addresses. And when you want to work with an API, you just find the right endpoints, the right internet address you want to use.

And then you send authentication. You send a formatted message to this address. And then the tool, external tool does its stuff and then gives you back an answer.

And that's as simple as that. So a typical use case is when you want to connect your Cloud Code with email, like Gmail, Google Docs, or to your CRM to add data or pull data from your CRM or post to social media. Every social media platform has an API, which is, once again, an interface that you can discuss programmatically with.

Or if you want to fetch data from a database, you will use the API of the database tool. You want to work with an external tool, find the API you need. And if I go, for instance, if I take the example of Gamma, which is the API I'm using to create presentation automatically.

So you can see in my business OS, I have some files related to Gamma API. Let's suppose I want to connect to Notion. Never done that before.

But I could ask Cloud Code to, hey, find the documentation of the Notion API so that I can create notes in my Notion account and I can pull data from my Notion account. OK, as simple as this. And then Cloud Code will just make some web research to find the API documentation.

Hopefully it won't be too long. Fetch it, so read it. And then once again, remember, authentication, then sending formatted message, then receiving answers and doing your stuff with the answer.

So here, basically, what I would need to do is to get my API key from Notion, put it in a .nv file that is here where I put all my credentials. And then Cloud Code will write the script according to what I need to do. Of course, I can make that evolve.

And if I just explain in plain English what I want, Cloud Code, knowing the Notion API documentation, can just translate what I want into, OK, what are the URL in the Notion API we need to work with? What's the format of the data? What's the protocol to authenticate? And then it will manage that and create the script that allows me to do this. Of course, I would test that and so on. But that's as simple as that.

According to the API and how well they are built, and it depends on the external tool, you may take some time to make it work. But basically with Cloud Code, you don't need any coding skills, which means once you know an API you want to work with, once you get API keys or whatever is necessary to authenticate with this API, you're good to go. You can create a bridge and then you can get this external tool working with your environment.

OK, if you see here, it's looking for the right format to discuss with the Notion API. I will stop there because actually I'm not using Notion. For me, Notion is a distraction, but I know that many people like Notion, so that would be a simple manner to connect Notion to your Cloud Code environment.

OK, you can see here authentication, the API basics here, and then here it's documenting how to create a page or a note in Notion programmatically. We don't care about this. That's the format, OK, of the message we should post, which means send to the Notion API URL to create a page.

OK, that's the type of format that we need to send. An example, if you want to retrieve something from Notion, we send that to the right endpoint, the right URL, which is database. Can you see here? The URL was a page.

Here it's database. And then, of course, database ID, which is the identification of the database you want to pull information from. And that's it.

And so now here, would you like me to create a complete Python or JavaScript script for a specific use case? I could say yes. I will stop there because once again, I'm not using Notion. But just to show you that you don't need to be a coder and the concept is pretty simple.

API, once again, it's an external interface you can use to programmatically connect with an external tool. And that is just URLs. And you send message to this URL.

You get answers. OK, you send message, which are requests on the URL. The external tool does its stuff based on the message you send.

The only thing is that the message needs to be properly formatted. The authentication must be properly handled, most of the time with API keys. And then once the tool has done its job, it gives you back whatever results you needed.

And then you can process it inside your cloud code. Very simple. OK, so advantages.

And we can stop copy-pasting between tools. And look, we don't need AI workflows. We don't need Zapier.

We don't need Mac.com. We don't need all that any longer. We can do it like side notes. The only use case when you need a Mac.com or a Zapier or a N8n is when you want an automation to be triggered whenever, when you're not in front of your computer and when you're not working.

If you want background automation, yes, these scenarios are useful. Why? Because cloud code works only when your computer is alive and when you're working on your computer. But in my case, I have very few use cases where I need this workflow automation.

And most of the time, if I need them, it's super simple. Anyways, so when you have an external tool that you're using, be it Notion, Figma, Miro, whatever, your CRM, Rtable and so on, they all have API and they all have API documentation. And so you can make research with cloud code to find the API documentation and make cloud code ingest the API documentation and then create whatever bridge you want with these external tools.

That works great. This being said, there is a new protocol that makes working with external tool theoretically easier. And these are MCPs.

It's worth having a look at this because it's a very promising standard and might probably be the best way to connect with external tool in the future. It's still in development, so it's not perfect, but let's have a look at this. MCPs are a standardized manner for AI agents to communicate with external tools.

It's a protocol that helps your agent understand what are the tools available in an external app and call this tool properly. In MCPs, you can have also additional stuff, like you can have prompts and stuff like this, but hey, let's keep it simple. So think MCPs as a power adapter for different countries, different tools.

Cloud code is the device, the services are the countries or the tools, and the MCPs is the standardized adapter. Okay, so that's an easy manner to connect cloud, cloud code or any AI agent to external tools. So there is lots of hype around MCPs because MCPs bring official plugins, pre-made toolbox for a given external app that your agent immediately understands and can tap into and use, right? That's the theory.

Everything being standardized, that means it's easy to develop MCPs and also it's easy for any AI agent or cloud code to use an MCPs. It knows the standard, it knows how to identify the tools that are available, it knows how to use the tools and then apply the tools, the external app, right? And normally it's auto-integrate, which means cloud code is able to understand what tools it needs, look for the right tools, then use it and that's it, okay? So you don't even need normally to request for the use of the tool, even if it's always better to enforce it to be sure that everything is done fine, okay? But the reality is that it's a new technology, so there's big hype, but it still needs maturity. I've seen many MCPs popped up with big claims and actually they are crap.

Why? Because they are poorly developed, they are not stable, or you can install them in an easy manner on some AI agent, like in cloud, but not necessarily in cloud code, like that's a mess. And even when you use them, actually they're not necessarily fulfilling the promises. So if I were you, I would only use official MCPs that are supported by the community and that are well documented and up to date, obviously for reliability issues.

I will be very cautious with open source MCPs. Why? Because you don't know the quality of them, you don't know if they are up to date, you don't know if they are well documented, that's really tricky. Theoretically, you can create your own custom MCPs because MCPs is just a protocol that ends up making it easier to connect your cloud code or your AI agents with external tools.

Easier than having to do it manually, understanding the APIs and creating scripts to make API calls. But at the end of the day, this is packaged API calls, right? Just it helps AI agents to automatically understand what are the tools so that they can invoke them automatically without you doing nothing and understand immediately what are the set of tools and points that are available and how to use them. Okay, so it's really a protocol to make life easier for AI agents and leverage AI to use external tools properly according to context.

That's at the end of the day, it's a packaging. This is why it's a communication protocol. So once you use MCP, use MCP when you have a proven, official, ideally MCP for an app, an external tool you want to plug on your cloud code or AI agent system.

If no MCP exists, I advise you, or if you can just find some crappy open source MCPs, I advise you to use API scripts, the thing we've seen just before. Same if you need custom logic or specific use of external tool, use API scripts. Let me show you how to install MCP and what it looks like.

Okay, so I like this GitHub repo, model context protocol, which is what MCP means, slash servers. Why? Because it's an official one. You have lots of MCPs here.

Let's pick one. We'll pick Playwright, which is a Microsoft MCP. It's a browser automation MCP that uses Playwright to run tests, navigate pages, capture screenshots, create content, automate web interaction reliably.

Pretty much giving your cloud code, if you're using cloud code, access to internet and visualizing web pages and working with web pages. So that's pretty cool, right? So if I click there, I go in this page here, and here I have the information about the MCPs. But since we are not coders, we won't check that.

But just here, quick review here, 23k stars. That means lots of people are using that and rated it. Here you have the releases.

The latest one is this one. It was released yesterday, which means it's an MCP that is actively worked on and updated, right? Many contributors, etc. It's a really good indication that the MCP is actually legit.

And so if you want to install your MCP in code, you can either ask Cloud Code directly. Hey, I want to use this MCP, do it. What I like to do is I like to check that there are something in the MCP that is perfect to install in Cloud Code.

They have implemented quick installation for Cloud Code. And so here, that means if we want to use it in Cloud Code, we just need to use that, that line here in Cloud Code. So let's go back in Cloud Code here.

OK, we paste it. I can say I will give some context. Hey, I want to install globally the Playwright MCP and then validate.

And so it will execute the command and that's it. It's installed. It's as easy as that.

When you want to install validated MCPs, legit one, it's pretty straightforward. Now, I've seen myself struggling a lot with some underground MCPs, so I don't recommend to spend too much time on that. OK, so now I have my Playwright MCP that has been successfully installed globally.

And so it's added to the cloud configuration. I should find it in this folder if I want to check. Let's keep things simple.

And then it can automate web browsers, create dynamic web content, test web application, interact with web page programmatically. This one is really good when you're developing a new one, by the way. And so it's normally available globally.

So I will log that. Yes, let's do the three steps. By the way, in the meantime, I use the command slash mcp.

I can check MCP status and I can see, hey, Playwright is connected, whatever. And if I use the MCP, manage MCPs, now I need to continue in the terminal. It's no big deal.

And so it will open cloud code in my terminal, whatever. And now I have MCP. And so you can see here, Playwright is connected.

If I click on it, I can configure it. OK, so that's my Playwright MCP server. It's connected.

And there are 21 tools. And you can see in this Playwright MCP, there are 21 tools. Let's see what is in there.

You can see there are many tools, upload files, fill form, install browser specified in the config, press key, navigate. Basically, all these tools are actions that my agent, my cloud code, can do on a web interface to navigate it through the Playwright. OK, so nothing big here, just I wanted to show you how to install a MCP really quick and how to check that everything is running fine and how to check what kind of tool your cloud code has access to through this MCP.

OK, so no big deal here. Let's remove that. Oh, let's clean that properly.

We've covered a lot. Now let me show you how all these pieces fit together into a complete system. Let's make a quick recap.

So we've seen that with cloud code, you have several features and also several capabilities that make it a complete AI-powered system, especially in a business context. Once again, cloud code has been highly pushed for developers and coding use cases, but actually we are using it for business, and it's amazing. In cloud code, we have basically all folder structures which represent all different projects or tasks or teams according the way you want to call that.

I call that either project or my teams. And we have cloud.nd file that gives for each project, each team, each folder, instructions, mechanism, way of doing stuff inside the project, which means each time cloud code is called, it checks the cloud.nd files and it knows everything about the current work inside this project. So you can consider that as the business brain and the way your business or your business operating system is structured.

Then you have your sub-agent teams that can be available globally or locally at project level, and I consider that as my different department, my teams working for me. And they are self-requested by cloud code. And there are many manners to do this, but let's not enter into the details.

Then you have tools that you don't necessarily see internal tools. For instance, cloud code has tools to read files, to do web search and so on. Let's not take too much time on this.

Let's keep things simple. Cloud code manage, I mean, use the right tools at the right moment without you doing nothing. So it's kind of working in the background.

Then you have the skills, which are reusable workflows that are packaged and they can be shared between your teams of sub-agents or even between other users, like your teammates or your customers. Or exactly what I'm doing in CCTG, I'm sharing skills, some skills with you guys. And so all that for their structure, cloud.md files, sub-agent teams, skills, tools inside cloud code.

These are internal capabilities. On top of that, you have also the possibility to add external capabilities, external tools through APIs and MCPs. So you could build your own system, trying to understand how to use all that and then do trial and errors and so on.

But there is so much value to having pre-built systems so that you don't build from scratch. You don't spend months of work on just building the stuff, designing the folder structure, writing the cloud.md files, creating the sub-agents, testing them, improving them, removing the ones that are not working well, or building skills library, which takes time because each time you're building a skill, you need to test it, you need to improve it. That's work, right? Or setting up integration, testing API connection, testing MCPs.

And you could do this and spend lots of time doing this. Or you could deploy mine, the entire business OS with folder structure, cloud.md files, mechanism already built in. As well as my content team with the 14 sub-agents that I have in Magnetic Content OS, the strategy console, the AI Growth Engine plugin, which is yours.

That would be the AI Growth Engine with its framework, its structure, but applied to your business. With the productivity system, with the daily planning, productivity assessment already built in, taking your information, what you work on with Cloud Code on a daily basis to give you assessment about your productivity, to help you also prioritize using the Brutal Prioritization framework on the right stuff for your business. Having AI support to be productive and focused, of course, would have also my HR team, the GPT creation team, the GPT Express Mastery OS, and skills and scripts library that I developed for myself, only focusing on stuff that are useful for business, of course.

You can have access to all this here in the Cloud Code OS. This is what I'm sharing in Cloud Code OS. I'm sharing my systems, my teams, that you can deploy that right away inside your own business and leverage this full system.

And of course, you're not alone with just the system. I'm here through implementation calls to help you customize it or make it evolve as you see fit based on your need inside your business. And so that's the power of this Cloud Code OS program.

And so this program is definitely the fastest path for you if you want to have a fully integrated AI powered business operating system that helps you work on what matters inside your business with the right tool, leverage in a maximum manner the latest AI approach. I'm using these systems daily for my own business, which means I update them, I improve them. And of course, all these improvements and updates are transferred to you in the Cloud Code OS.

It's not a static product. It's a living, evolving system that is driven by my conception of the business, which is all about focus, prioritizing the right stuff inside the business, solving the immediate bottleneck and improving the aspect of the business that I call attract, attract the right customers, convert, convert the right customers, retain them, ensure that they are satisfied with the service, delivering outstanding service and ascend them, like selling them more stuff. I build everything around this, like the right focus and maximizing the attract, convert, retain, ascend function or dimension of the business.

So we'll talk more at the end about this, but first let me show you how Cloud Code itself operates because understanding this gives you more control. And here in the next part, I will show you some ways to use Cloud Code in a better manner. The cool stuff to do with Cloud Code is use the plan mode.

With the plan mode, you basically ask Cloud Code to think about what you ask it to do and it will write a plan. And also you can use natural language command like sync hard, sync harder or hook tracing to really push Cloud Code to use more token and think more about whatever problems you have asked it to solve or whatever task you want it to do. And so this plan mode is a read-only architect mode.

To activate it, I will show you, you can use shift tab or you can click on the right part of the interface. Then Cloud Code will analyze and propose the plan. You read the plan, you approve before execution.

For huge tasks or huge work I have to do with Cloud Code, I always use the plan mode so that I can review its approach, I can correct it. And sometimes I can better understand also how to implement a given task or a given project. And then I approve and then it executes.

It writes the to-dos. You've seen that there is a tool that Cloud Code calls often, which is to-do list that helps it be aligned with what it needs to do and not forget things. And so really the plan mode is super powerful.

And I really recommend that you use it each time you're working on significant projects so that you have architect Cloud Code mapping the plan, suggesting the plan and then you can validate. And it gives you also the blueprint of what would be done and so that you have no surprise when Cloud Code implements. The advantage of it, of course, it's safety and control.

It's also helping you to better think about a given project or given thing you want to implement with Cloud Code and that's super useful, right? It ensures that you have a structured approach. You know, back in the day when we were working with just prompt or even with just custom GPTs, we used to say, and that's a prompting technique, proceed step by step, explain to me what you will do first so that I can validate and so on. Here, it's same idea, but automatically done by Cloud Code in an optimal manner.

So let me show you what plan modes look like. OK, to activate plan mode, you can use here, this ticking here. You can shift to plan mode.

You can use shift tab as well and it will change it. And then I don't have any example here. I'd like to know how I can best explain to CCGG member the power of Cloud Code OS program and what is the value they would get from it and what they would avoid, what's the pain they will avoid by implementing it and what's the huge benefits they will get if they implement it.

Can you help me with that? OK, in here, I want to use plan mode so that Cloud Code can think about it, find some resources inside my CCGG Business OS and give me a plan to explain that to you, obviously. So you can see now it's collecting information. Yes, don't ask again.

And here, the cool stuff is that Cloud Code won't implement anything. If we just collect information, process that and then come up with a plan based on my request. So here it's gathering context and so on.

You can see it has found information about Cloud Code Business OS value proposition and now it's compiling findings into a clear organized response for me, the plan. So now it's the plan following my query here. So Cloud Code Business OS complete value proposition framework, the transformation from ChatGPT chat session to Cloud Code Business OS with integrated system that knows your entire business, persistent memory, strategic partner, automated operations and intelligence.

Point point, they will avoid money, where was I, friction. Strategic drift, weeks lost on low value work. What should I work on? Paralysis, decision fatigue daily.

Inconsistent productivity with no pattern visibility. You cannot analyze your work. Manual tracking hover.

OK, here we automate tracking. Blocked without knowing what's blocking you. Hidden dependencies.

Huge benefits that we get. Time freedom, strategic certainty, compounding intelligence, execution clarity, productivity optimization, project continuity, strategic leverage, plus seven integrated workflows. You have the daily operating system.

You have the strategic layer, the AI growth engine. You have the infrastructure layer with project lifecycle, workflow, system maintenance, different proof points, implementation path. You can start with the basic feature and work with the strategic feature and then use the complete system.

Positioning for CCG members and key messaging by avatars, simple pitch structure, files ready for you to use. OK, so that's the plan. And then I can say, yes, would you like me to create a specific deliverable using this framework, including YouTube scripts, sales page copy, workshop, etc.

So it's going beyond what I asked. But here I have a plan. It has gathered information, processed it, and then suggest me a plan with the different elements I could use and then told me about the resources, possibly implementation.

So that's a simple example of how to use plan mode. Now I can shift back to normal mode or I can just say execute and then it will execute. The plan mode is super powerful to plan your work and be sure that cloud can structure your approach and execute it in a sound manner.

Now let's talk about configuration control. I will cover here, the next part will cover settings versus instructions. Let's roll.

Here what I want to cover quickly is settings.json and cloud.md file. We have already covered cloud.md file. But there is another file which is settings.json. And this is the way it looks like in my CCDG Business OS.

I have a settings.json here and actually in the settings.json you can set up environment variables. Of course, you can use code code to do it for you. But just I want to show you what is inside.

A set of variables, some specific rules that you want to use at the project level here. That can be at the full system level if you go in your user.cloud subfolder because in there see the very same settings.json. Basically the settings.json is in any project you have inside cloud code. Let me show you that.

OK, in my root folder, my system root folder, I have also settings.json. There is nothing in there. Why? Because I don't work globally. I work only in my CCDG Business operation in this CCDG Business operation folder.

So here in my settings.json, my global settings.json, there is nothing. OK, in addition to variables and specific rules, you have also permissions and deny. You can see, for instance, I don't want anything from this project to write in my AI Growth Engine knowledge base.

OK, why? Because I want to keep the knowledge base untouched when I'm working actively on operations. The thing you need to understand is they add some layer of automation in your cloud code systems. You have an hierarchy of settings.json. You have the settings.local.json that will work on your local project only for you.

That's the one that will be taken into account first. Then if you don't have that one, you have the settings.json that works at the project level, but that can be used by other users as well if they have access to your project. And then you have the general one that I showed you before, which is this one here in the .cloud subfolder of the root user folder.

And this is a settings.json that works globally, but it's the weakest. That's the one that will be used the last only if there is nothing else in the previous one. Just the thing to understand is that the settings.json set machine readable controls in a JSON format that gives tools permission, model selection, hooks, environment variables, NCPs and so on.

Most of the time, you don't need to take care about this, even if you can use it to enforce permission or authorization and so on. But really in a business context, most likely you won't pay too much attention to that. But I want to mention it anyways.

And you have the cloud.nd files, which is human readable. So that's good for you to understand also what is done in a given project. And that, of course, is exploited by Cloud Code also to have context when it's starting a new session inside a project or inside a team or inside a department or inside a folder.

For me, folder on your machine can correspond to a specific project, to a specific team and workflows or a specific department, like I call them. Department like in a company. You have your department with your teams, your subagents and all that sit inside a folder that can have a cloud.nd file that gives context and instructions and a settings.json that gives some consideration elements and permissions.

They work together. You don't need to pay too much attention to the settings.json. I've spent, I mean, I've worked hundreds of hours with my Cloud Code and I barely pay attention to that one. The cloud.nd file is the most important, in my opinion, from my experience.

Now, can you have tools everywhere and tools only for specific projects? Yes, that's the notion of hierarchy. I already covered that a bit when explaining the settings.json. Maybe I did a poor job explaining this to you. So I hope you're not confused.

But let's try to clarify this notion. OK, let's talk about hierarchies, settings hierarchy from the highest to the lowest. So that's what I've tried to explain like a few minutes ago.

You have local project settings. In the .cloudsettings.local.json, that's your personal tweak. It won't be available for other teammates.

It won't be available on GitHub if you have synchronized what you do on Cloud Code with GitHub. Then you have shared project settings in the .cloudsettings.json. And all these .cloud subfolders are available in all folders you're working on with Cloud Code, right? It's everywhere. Every project or department or teams or workflows you're working on inside a folder on your computer, there is a .cloud subfolder and they have settings.local.json. Most of the time, there's nothing in there.

Side note here. OK, so the two first layers, local project, shared project. You can see in the shared project, actually, it's checked on Git.

So it can be used by other teammates who have access to the same project if you share a project. And then you have the personal global settings in your user folder, subfolder.cloud and file is settings.json. And that's your preferences, the personal everywhere. An analogy to understand that is that you can have a personal toothbox and that's what is in the .cloud subfolder of your root user folder.

So that's the tools you carry everywhere personally. Then you have team workshops inside your project in the .cloud subfolder of a project folder. And then you have your personal tweaks, which is the settings.local.json. OK, the settings merge.

They are not replaced, but with another priority and the higher priority of a rise is specified. And from what I've experienced and understood, this one for you has more priorities as this one that has more priority this one. This logic of hierarchy is true for other objects inside Cloud Code.

For agents, for instance, you can have agents in a specific folder. You can have agents in your .cloud subfolder of your user root folder. And if they are just local, they are applied to the project.

Only if they are in the .cloud subfolder of the user root folder, they apply everywhere. Same for skills. I know that like currently, November 2025, there are some issues about the capacity to invoke skills that are locally implemented.

This being said, that's a detail. It has not prevented me from doing what I wanted to do. So it's a detail, but I mentioned it.

OK, key mechanism, automatic discovery. So when Cloud Code works, it scans folders. And so you don't have to say anything to Cloud Code.

It will just scan the folder and see what is available in the settings.json files. And the same with Cloud.md files, by the way. Some elements like skills are auto activated.

And once again, skills can be in your user folder. It can be in the project folder, right? Normally, they are automatically invoked by Cloud Code. Sometimes I recommend you to enforce the invocation by Cloud Code, by mentioning that you wanted to use the skill.

That is the safe path, I would say. There is another thing that I've shown you previously without mentioning too much about this, is command. When you use the slash key, if I go there, you have access to command.

You can see here, you can navigate to different commands and you have the slash command here. OK, like compat, content formatter and so on. To be honest, I rarely use the command, but this is your way also to trigger specific command manually without relying on Cloud Code to invoke automatically skills or other stuff like this.

So the difference I see with skills and command is that skills can be auto invoked, whereas command, it's you ask Cloud Code to do specifically something using a command. And I will tell you more about command in a few minutes. And so this hierarchy of settings.json, but also on skills, on agents, helps you to contain this object or this feature at different level, either just for you personally or globally on your system with other people having access to part of your project, for instance.

I've tried to cover configuration control, control. This being said, most of this, I told you that so that you understand and you know that it exists. But really, when you're using your system, when you're using Cloud Code, you don't need to manage that too much, especially if you're using it solo.

Now, if you're using with other teammates, that's another story. Now, how can you try what Cloud Code does? Let's talk about logging. Let's cover logging and tracking.

So in Cloud Code, you have building Cloud Code logging stuff. Cloud Code tracks tool usage. It logs error and it keeps session history.

So if you open a Cloud Code session, I already showed you that. But if I open a, if I check this one, for instance, here you can see I have my session history and I can open one and I will go on with what I did in this given session. OK, so that means you can reuse sessions.

So Cloud Code is keeping history and logging stuff. But that's not enough. Why? Because it's mostly technical stuff or just chat sessions.

I've implemented my own custom business logging logic using several mechanisms, logging different operations in a structured manner, integrating that with different other workflows and processes. This is not part of Cloud Code by default. This is part of Cloud Code OS and this is something you can access to in the Cloud Code OS program.

OK, I'm continuously improving this because what I want to do with the right logging system, I want to be able to track the work that has been done to do some analysis over time about the work that is done, about alignment of strategic priorities and many, many other stuff for which logging what you do in a structured manner and clever manner is super useful. Really here we are leveraging if you have the right systems and you will have when you join Cloud Code OS, you can really take another step in terms of tracking your work, planning your work, analyzing your work, understanding what happened, if there is any derail or issues and many, many other stuff. Understanding what teams are doing, teams or project or workflow inside Cloud Code are doing, understanding how to improve that, doing some improvement analysis, like the sky is the limit.

This is what you would like to have in your normal business with your teammates. OK, except here you don't need them. It's automated and it's well structured and you can process cross project, cross team, across time analysis and so on.

You have a real business journal optimized for business perspective, for business objectives and for business use. You can flip back anytime, you can track your progress, you can analyze patterns, like that's so powerful. And that's where real business values sit with such a system as the Cloud Code OS.

Because now you know exactly what Cloud Code has worked on, but also what you are, your teammates, if you put them in the system, have worked on. You can spot patterns, you can check efficiency of workflows, you can find bottlenecks, you can find productivity derail, you can find like many stuff. You can do audit trail for compliance, you can use it for continuous improvement.

And the cool stuff is that all this is done automatically and that's super powerful. If I show you an example, for instance, if I check yesterday, I did a productivity assessment. So you can see here, I can come back to the right transition and that's my productivity assessment.

And look what it has spotted. Pattern identified. Infrastructure building crowds out execution for two consecutive days.

Why? Because I had set business priorities I should have worked on last Saturday. And actually I spent some time creating what it calls infrastructure, which are basically systems. Instead of working on the business priorities, I worked on infrastructure.

And so it has spotted this because obviously I haven't been able to address some priorities I needed to work on. And it's analyzed why I did that and did some recommendation, which is A, it's okay to work on infrastructure, but do it after the one thing, after working on the main topics you have planned for the day. And it was able to do this because it tracked everything I do.

And it understands the strategic environment, strategic, how to say that, priorities. And also the different projects I'm working on, the different tasks I'm working on. Okay, you can see the power of it.

That's crazy. Anyway, sometimes you want to trigger specific workflows manually. And so that's when you use custom commands.

So we have already covered really quickly custom commands in the previous chapter, but let's take a closer look to this. You already have pre-built commands in Cloud Code. And I already showed you this.

If you type slash, you have pre-built commands, all that, okay. But you can also set up your own commands, which are basically workflows and processes, simple processes that you can trigger manually so that Cloud Code executes them. And so what are custom commands? They are user-initiated multi-step workflows.

They are stored in, once again, in a .cloud folder, in a subfolder that is commands, and you can invoke them just using the command name. Some analogy, it's a bit like a macro in Excel or a shortcut on your phone. It's just a sequence of operations that you can trigger anytime.

And the difference between skills and commands, because that might be a question you have, is that skills are auto-invoked by Cloud. They're automatic, context-based, which means Cloud Code understands the context and identifies the skills that match the context, and then will use the skills and use progressive disclosure, go deeper if necessary, take some resources that are inside the skills, maybe a script that is inside the skills, and execute. Whereas custom commands, it's you invoke manually and trigger explicitly something that Cloud Code has to do.

And so typically, it's very useful for recurring workflows. For instance, if you want to do weekly planning, you can have a custom command to do this. It's also useful for complex sequences, when you have multi-step processes to do, and when you want to standardize process and trigger them manually with full control.

And so how you can create that command, custom command, you use Cloud Code and you ask for a custom command, okay? You explain what you want and Cloud Code will help you create the custom command. And basically what Cloud Code will do, it will create a file that we put in the .cloud slash commands subfolder. Once it's done, you just call the custom command with the slash and the name of the command.

Okay, and if I show you what a custom command looks like, let me find one for you. In my ccgg business operation, in my .cloud folder, I have here a command, which is init business. And you can see, like skills, like sub-agents, it's a markdown file, a .md file, with a YAML header metadata with a description.

And this is what this command does. It's initialize business project cloud.md with business specific guidance. It has some tools.

It can use read, write, edit globe, which are the basic tools of Cloud Code. And then just the md file instruct what Cloud Code should do when I trigger this command, init business. It's a custom command I have created so that I have Cloud Code creating a project infrastructure with a cloud.md file that is specifically structured for what I want to do.

So I want Cloud Code to do something in a specific manner and I want to trigger it manually. I use a custom command. Enough with commands.

Now, how about syncing Cloud's work with external systems? Interesting, right? So let's talk about GitHub and how to do backup, version control and collaboration. So GitHub is really for coders, but guess what? We are using Cloud Code, not for code. We are not developers.

We are just normal people, entrepreneurs who have businesses and want to leverage the power of AI to run our business in a lean, effective and focused manner so that we can get free, right? OK, so I'm using GitHub for a different purpose, to backup the work I do inside my business OS, of course, to control the version, to be able to revert back in a more automated manner if need be, and also to sometimes collaborate with other people, right? So what is GitHub? Quickly, it's kind of a drop box for code with time travel. So you can backup stuff, you can control version, you can collaborate, you can time travel. That means you can revert back what you did.

And there are lots of many other stuff, but for our purpose, that's the main stuff to understand, the main features of GitHub to understand. There are many other stuff you can do for GitHub. It's a very powerful tool for coders.

But for us, it's good enough. You can work in parallel and test different approach in parallel to check the ones you prefer and then merge the one you prefer on the main projects. You can do so many stuff, whatever.

The advantage is for business is that you can recover for any issues. That's a backup, OK? Which means you can also use your system on another computer if need be. Why? Like, let's suppose that your computer is dying because one of the problems with code is that you work on local files, right? And what if you have a virus or what if your computer is dying? Now you're screwed.

Not any longer if you have a backup system on GitHub because now you can open another computer, inside your GitHub account, import everything inside your new installation and you're good to go. You can also control the version history so you can see the system evolution. You can collaborate with other people, experiment safely.

You can audit stuff, understand who work on what and who change what. If you have several people working on the same Cloud Code business OS and it gives you remote access because you can access from any machine as well. And so how it works, you ask Cloud Code to create a GitHub repo.

You connect Cloud Code to GitHub. It's something you do once. And then if you give access to Cloud Code to the GitHub CLI, which is some sort of module, Cloud Code is able to create whatever repo in your GitHub account.

And so that makes stuff way easier. And then of course, Cloud Code can commit changes, which mean push changes on your GitHub repo and commit them so that now they are alive. You can also synchronize between your local Cloud Code business OS and what is inside GitHub.

You can Cloud Revert, collaborate anytime. That's super powerful. That's really easy to set up.

You ask Cloud Code and at some point it will ask you to connect to GitHub with your authentication method. You do this, you accept connection, you accept the synchronization, the connection between Cloud Code and GitHub and you're good to go. That's really straightforward.

Let me bring it all together because we have covered many things here. And let me show you what's next. So we have covered a lot.

We have covered file-based memory and system prompt with cloud.md files. We have covered sub-agents organized as teams that allows you sequential or parallel execution, having the sub-agent auto-orchestrated by Cloud Code. We have covered skills with our reusable workflows, which are standard operating procedures that you can equip your Cloud Code system with or that you can also equip your teammates using Cloud Code with so that you can enforce SOPs at the company level.

We have covered parallel execution, whereas it is with sub-agents working in parallel or tools that Cloud Code calls in parallel. We have covered access to external tools through API integration and MCPs. We have covered some feature that makes the work of Cloud Code more effective, like plan modes, some commands.

We have covered the difference between settings with settings.json files that are more for machine reading and cloud.md instruction well-fit for you to understand what happens at the project level and also for Cloud Code to load context when it starts a new session in any project. We have talked about hierarchy, how you can organize skills, agents and settings.json files at different levels so that it can be used by only you locally on your machine, everybody working on a given project or globally on your system. We have covered logging mechanism quickly that is super useful for many business use cases like productivity assessment, planning, strategic alignment checking and many other stuff.

We have covered custom commands quickly, how you can set up small automation or specific workflows that you can trigger manually, which is a bit different from skills where skills are triggered automatically, invoke automatically by Cloud Code. Custom commands helps you standardize some stuff you do and trigger them manually. And then we have covered backup and version control using GitHub in a very quick manner.

So you can see that when you understand all these features, you have a complete system. But actually that's just step one, knowing the features, understanding how they work and where you can access them, it's only step one. Step two, it's implementing a cohesive system that combines all these features in a smart manner for a business context in order to increase business efficacy, in order to increase focus on what matters inside the business and in order to increase the power of execution of your business, leveraging AI-powered system the best manner.

Of course, you can make your own trial and error and spend weeks, maybe months to try to set up the system or you can use a pre-made one. And that's exactly what I give you in Cloud Code OS inside CCGD community. In the Cloud Code OS, you have the entire business OS.

That's the one I use for myself. So you can be sure that it's top-notch and I make it better consistently. When you have my business OS, you have the folder structure that is directly applicable to your business.

You have the cloud.md files, which has the system prompts and a smart logic for the different folders and different projects. You have an already integrated mechanism for productivity, for planning, for cross-project analysis and so on. You have also my own teams, my department.

You have my content team with the Magnetic Content OS that has more than 14 sub-agents to work on any type of content on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, etc. Working on hooks, working on thumbnails, working on all that stuff related to content. Applying the content framework that I teach also in CCGG.

You have what I call my strategic console, which is the AI Gross Engine plugin with all the frameworks to really describe in a strategic manner your offer, your target avatar, your strategy, your funnels, your different products and so on. You have my productivity system with the daily planning, with the productivity assessment, with the logging systems to log the different projects, to log the different tasks, to log the different change that you do with Cloud Code inside your business environment. You have, of course, my HR department, what I call my HR department, which is the GPT creation team.

The GPT Express Mastery OS that uses my GPT Express Mastery framework to craft custom GPTs, but also some agents, but at a superior level, way better than what you would do with just Cloud Code or just Cloud or just a chat GPT. Why? Because it's using a method that I've experimented with for more than two years and that I've taught to many people who just can tell you that it's a crazy good framework to craft superior custom GPTs and AI agents. But there is more.

You will also have access to essential skills, like the skills factory, for instance, the skills to build other crazy good skills and other skills that I develop based on business use case and business needs. You also have some scripts library to connect with external tools and you just need to put your own API keys and you're good to go. And that would be much more because once again, this is the AI part business system to grow lean GPT business, a business that is optimized with lean processes to focus really on what matters to grow the business, implementing the best approaches to attract, convert, retain ascent customers without having to spend months to learn them.

That would be much more. I will update this based on how I use the system and how other members in the Cloud Code OS are using the system to get results and also based on the new stuff that Entropiq will release for Cloud Code because guess what? Cloud Code is a big bet that Entropiq made. This is a tool they are investing massively to make better and there is so much great stuff that will come in the future and that will be updated inside Cloud Code OS.

Here, the key difference is that you're not building anything from scratch. You can just take the resources I share with you. These are folders, basically, that you put on your computer and you're good to go.

You open Cloud Code in your Visual Studio Code interface and you go in the right folder and good to go. Everything is there, already set up, right? So you can deploy in minutes what I've built, tested, and refined for days, weeks, months. If you're joining the Cloud Code OS program, you have my support through implementation, group calls that we do, and also you have access to me through DM, and so we can discuss about your specific case and I can help you tweak a bit the pre-made system that's already there and that you can deploy in minutes.

It's a living system. I update it constantly and my updates are directly implemented in Cloud Code OS so that you can benefit from them. And of course, you may have some specific requests and if they all make sense, I can implement them as well, which means here we are leveraging Cloud Code OS, we are leveraging collective intelligence to make our business OS better with time.

So finally, if you're a business owner, whereas you have an online business, whereas you're a coach, you're a service provider, you do consulting, or you need to create content, or you do product development, this is for you. If you want an AI team to handle execution inside your business so they can focus on strategy and you can just orchestrate your teams, your department as a CEO, that's for you because this Cloud Code OS is the business operating system that you can use right away to have these teams working for you and you can tweak it also with the support inside the community. And so if you want proven systems that are ready to deploy immediately, you can learn more about this in CCGG, MySQL community, and here in Cloud Code OS.

This is the module where everything happens and where the resources to have your own AI-powered business OS inside Cloud Code are sitting, waiting for you. So I hope you enjoy this Cloud Code Mastery for Business course and I see you inside CCGG.
