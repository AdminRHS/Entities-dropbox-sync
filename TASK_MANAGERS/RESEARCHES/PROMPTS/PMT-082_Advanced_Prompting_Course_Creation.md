## Prompt Instructions

### Base Prompt

```
Hey! I create a learning course for employees on advanced prompting in different AIs. Each lesson of the course must teach advanced prompting in another AI. Please conduct deep research on courses, tutorials, videos, etc around the internet and compile lessons on that AI. Make the theoretical part really short, and focus on possible use cases and details on how to tailor prompts and make that AI work. Now, compile a lesson "Advanced Prompting in [AI name]"
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Replace `[AI name]`** with the target AI platform (e.g., "Claude", "ChatGPT", "Midjourney", "Gemini")
2. **Provide Context**: Optionally include specific use cases or department focus
3. **Review Output**: Verify research quality and practical focus

## Expected Output Structure

Each lesson should include:
- **Brief Introduction** (2-3 paragraphs max)
- **Use Cases** (specific, practical applications)
- **Prompt Tailoring Guide** (how to customize prompts for this AI)
- **Workflow Examples** (step-by-step processes)
- **Best Practices** (tips and common pitfalls)
