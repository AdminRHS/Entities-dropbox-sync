# Remote Helpers Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete framework implementation for Task Templates, company guidance, and AI-accessible organizational structure

---

## 🎯 Overview

This framework represents a **Template-Driven, AI-First Organization** with a sophisticated multi-layer architecture designed to scale from 30 to 40+ employees across 7 departments and 4 business platforms. The system is built on **normalized data structures**, **entity-based organization**, and **automated workflows** that enable AI agents to access and process information efficiently.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Entity-Driven Architecture:** Data organized by WHAT it is (entity type) rather than WHERE it's stored (department folders)
2. **Template Multiplication:** Hierarchical template system creating exponential scalability
3. **Multi-Platform Unification:** 4 business platforms sharing common infrastructure
4. **AI-First Design:** Built from ground up with AI capabilities as core requirements
5. **Measurement-Driven Evolution:** Every component has metrics enabling data-driven refinement

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Entity Model

The framework is built on 8 primary entity types:

1. **JOBS** - Job openings, requirements, and talent matching
2. **BUSINESSES** - Client relationships from prospect to loyal client
3. **TALENTS** - Human capital from application through employment lifecycle
4. **TASK_MANAGERS** - Operational engine orchestrating work execution
5. **LIBRARIES** - Centralized repository of reusable components
6. **Accounts** - Variable fields and configuration options
7. **CATEGORIES** - Hierarchical and semantic groupings
8. **SETTINGS** - Core system settings and reference data

### Task Template Structure

**Format:** `ACTION` + `OBJECT` + `CONTEXT`

- **ACTION** - Standardized verb from Actions Library
- **OBJECT** - Business entity from Objects Library
- **CONTEXT** - Specific details or parameters

**Example:** `Create` + `Job Posting` + `for Frontend Developer`

## 📚 Knowledge Library System

Documents are organized using Library of Congress style classification:

**Call Number Format:** `[SECTION].[SUBSECTION].[YEAR].[MONTH].[SEQUENCE]`

**Example:** `LG.002.2025.10.024` = Lead Generation, Cluster 2, 2025, October, Document 24

### 8 Major Shelves

1. **OP** - Operations & Automation
2. **LG** - Lead Generation & Sales
3. **DS** - Design & Creative
4. **TR** - Onboarding & Training
5. **PS** - Presentation & Storytelling
6. **TI** - Technical Infrastructure
7. **DP** - Documentation & Processes
8. **OK** - Organizational Knowledge
