## Prompt Instructions

### Base Prompt

```
Hey! I create a learning course for employees on working in GenSpark. Please conduct deep research on courses, tutorial, videos, etc around the internet, find all kinds of application of GenSpark and make a lesson on each. In each lesson, make a theoretical part really short, just two or three paragraphs, and then focus on the work that can be done and detailed guide on working process and tailoring prompts.

Also, create two intro lessons. The first, what is GenSpark and brief enumeration of its applications. The second is how to start working in GenSpark.
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Execute Base Prompt**: Run the full prompt in Gemini
2. **Review Structure**: Verify intro lessons and application lessons are created
3. **Validate Content**: Ensure each lesson follows the format (short theory + detailed workflow)
