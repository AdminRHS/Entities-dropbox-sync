We're going to in the agents section, uh, you can see that you can actually just go and hire so to speak an agent. Uh, and that's where you kind of want to start. Why why do you want to start here is because you don't have you could obviously build your own agent or build your own workflows, but it's the simplest just to see use someone who's optimized it already."

Um, and if you're anything like me, you've used Nano Banana, and sometimes you get amazing results and sometimes you don't. Um, and I think it's because of the prompting. So let's go ahead and see if Nano Banana could go and redesign one of my thumbnails, uh, to be, um, more Mr. Beast style. Um, so I'm going to go ahead and copy this into glif."

And then we hand it on a, you know, silver platter for you to go check out. Um, we do have a few paid plans that, you know, take it to the next level, uh, give you more ideas, give you more AI agents and more, almost like a chat GPT for ideas with it. But you can start for free, ideabrowser.com. And if you're listening to this, I highly recommend it."

This is sort of the missing step, um, one of the missing steps in Nano Banana and other creative AI tools is, uh, you know, it it you need to analyze this and you need to figure out what is the best prompt based on that, right? So, it's a, it gives me the prompt. Here's your Mr. Beast style redesign. A high energy YouTube thumbnail redesign featuring a man with short wavy brown hair and glasses making an exaggerated shocked expression, of course. So this is very, very Mr. Beast. You can see it has the aspect ratio, so you get, hopefully get back the YouTube, uh, thumbnail in the right size, and it created three different variants. Red explosion, split screen, interesting that it included this because this is like a tried and trued format in YouTube when you have a slit, a, a split screen. Uh, maybe it's like a sad face on the left and a and a happy face on the right. Um, and then it asks you to generate. Okay, cool. Um, I've gone ahead and by the way, I've added $10 of credits for for this video. Uh, it's cool actually. I didn't see like a monthly fee. I just saw you can buy $10 of credits. Um, but you could use this for free. I I tried doing this for free and you get like a few prompts for free and if you actually want to go and create videos and multiple images, you're going to need $10 or something like that."

Um, and I bet you, like I should AB test that. I don't know what happened to my top lip, but you know, this is the type of thing that would work. Um, and it's definitely, you know, it's definitely, what's also cool is I've used this image before. So now I've got this like other image that I haven't, you know, I didn't have to go into a photo shoot for. So love that it's done that. Um, and that's Nano Banana ultimate. Where I can see myself using this also is, you know, icons, make it a mascot, uh, for my, my startup, ideabrowser.com, uh, you know, there's so many, you know, brand identity stuff and just creating references images that you can go ahead and use in other creative AI. So, uh, I would say that this this was really good. It it it definitely exceeded my expectations and I can see myself using this."

        "line": "Okay, so the next, uh, the next demo that we're going to do is the miniature history for brand. So we're going to go back into, um, the agent area and you can see here, uh, this agent uses Seedream and VAYU 2.2 with Eleven Labs to create a short 32 second tilt shift, uh, and you can see here that these are the the little videos I was talking about. I just think this is cool because, um, you're you're constantly looking for as a brand, you're constantly looking for ways to tell your stories. And if you can tell your story in something that's like a little more interesting and a little more scroll stopping, then you you have your, you're increasing your odds of probability of success, right? So, um, we could here they're using the example for history, but I think that uh, I'd love to to give it a story. Um, let's just click here, tell me what I can do and and see what what what it says."

        "timestamp": "09:56",
        "line": "I create historical videos in tilt shift miniature style. These short videos make complex topics seem like toy models. Here's my process. You give me a historical topic, an event, figure, or era. I research it to get the facts straight. I create a video plan with four varied image scenes, a narrative voiceover, animation prompts for each scene. You approve the plan. I generate everything, tilt shift images, voiceover animations, period appropriate music. I stitch it all together with subtitles. The result is a 40 second historical documentary that looks like it was filmed with a miniature diorama. So that's really cool. So, the historical topic, let's do, let's do the historical topic of Facebook going IPO. So I don't know how historical that is, but I'm just thinking, um, I'm just thinking like, I have this business, ideabrowser.com, which gives people startup ideas, gives them people prompts to go build those startup ideas. So if I'm trying to build let's say an Instagram account, um, like I might want to share stories of founders who've done a really, you know, who who've created really big companies, right? So, you can see it's gone and created the image prompts to start. So you can see like the scene one, modern glass wall office building exterior in Silicon Valley. The different scenes here, interior of the Nasdaq stock exchange. Young tech CEO in a casual hoodie. Um, and it's gone and create the the voice over script. May 18th, 2012, Facebook prepared for the most anticipated tech tech IPO in history. Mark Zuckerberg's social network would go public. Shares price at $38. So it's gone and actually researched with perplexity, uh, to go and and actually get the facts straight. Of course, if you're doing this, I would want to make sure, just double check that it's it's correct, you know? Perplexity could be wrong. Um, then it gives you the video animation prompts. So it does it for C dance light, which is great, right? Because for most of us, we would just probably go into SORA 2, um, we wouldn't be stitching together C dance or and others like that. And it goes and does it and says, and it says, uh, does this plan work for you? We're just going to say just generate it, um, but you could adjust the scripts, uh, you could change the video style format if you don't like it. Um, and what is happening right now is it's, uh, it looks like it's creating all the, yeah, are you kidding me? Yeah, this is crazy. Like that's the reference images. How cool is that? How cool is that? And that's the audio. Um, so it creates the audio here. Um, and then it says, do you want to generate the video? So we're going to go ahead and generate the video and see what happens. So it's going and creating the videos. Um, and a lot of people will look at this and and be like, this is so silly, right? Like, why? Like historical videos, like it's so silly. How is this going to make me money? How is this going to get me followers? How's this going to get me likes? Well, I think it's obvious how it's going to get followers and likes. I think the the non-obvious question is how does this, how does this help my business? And whenever you're, you know, when you're thinking about, you know, building your your business, you know, I always think about it like this. I call it the ACP funnel. I've talked about it on the pod before. You first create an audience, then create a community, then create a product. So, it's literally a funnel. It's literally a funnel and, you know, I think, uh, you know, you start with an audience and you can tell stories. This is where you can tell stories and this is where creative AI really plays a huge role. And then from that, you know, maybe you create a paid community, IRL events. And then from that, you're going to figure out what your product is. And that's when you vibe code something, and that's when you sell it to them. So, this is sort of the framework I use when I create any of my businesses, when I'm buying businesses, when I'm investing in businesses. And I think this gives you the highest probability of success. Let's go back to the glif."

So it knows that it's not just doing voice voiceover, but it knows that people like background music, right? Like these are the the nuances that you might have forgotten if you were just creating this on your own. And this hasn't taken that long. I mean, we're talking about a few minutes. Like this, I I've paid agencies to do this sort of stuff and it's thousands of dollars. Um, and it's ready. So, within about, I don't know, five minutes, we've been able to do it. Uh, and let's go ahead and watch it."

Okay, adding subtitles to the video. So, um, I would say like, it's not bad. Like, in the sense that Like it's not bad. Like it's not, it's close.

        "line": "The last use case we're going to show is these TikTok Reddit stories. So, I'm sure you've seen this on TikTok, you know, the Minecraft videos, basically, it's brain rot for sure, but, you know, some people love them. This has 43,000 likes. Um, you know, if you can find a way that you can use Reddit for these interesting stories, post it, uh, and create audiences, create likes and ultimately sell some of your software or startups, that's, that's what you, you know, is a viable channel for you. So, can Glif figure that out for us? Um, so I'm going to say, go and create an awesome TikTok video from the r/SaaS subreddit. Why why from the r/SaaS subreddit? If I'm doing this for, you know, ideabrowser.com, you know, SaaS subreddit, I'm sure it has a bunch of start, you know, people who've built software as a service and they're, you know, I would want to attract those people, right? So, it's gone ahead and used web search, XO web search, it's found how I built a $1 million SaaS just by posting on Reddit. Um so, classic hustle story, underdog story. Um, and then it asks you to pick your style approach, drama, educational, mystery, lifestyle. In this case, educational, like we want to teach people about building software and building SaaS. Um, how fast do you want to go? Ultra fast, fast, medium, slow? Probably like pretty fast. Um but it's cool that you're able to, you know, drip feed that context into it. Do you want to gen z, brain rot, balance or thoughtful? Let's go with more of a balanced vibe. Let's go with another balanced vibe. Um and let's say we want to do 60 seconds. I'm actually surprised that, uh, you're able to do such long videos within within Glif. You know, I think it would be like 10 seconds, 15 seconds. Here you can see that it it's created seven clips that are 8 and 1/2 seconds each. Oh, so that's it. It's basically creating these clips and it's stitching it together. You can see that it's, uh, created the audio. Um, here's the hook, the problem, the strategy. So it's already gone ahead and created, um, created the script. The script is, you know, a developer turned a Reddit post into a million dollar SaaS. Here's how he did it. Um, you know, went on Reddit and identified subreddits where his target customers hung out, provided genuine value. He shared case studies, answered questions. So this is, this is good. Um, so that's just a quick tip, I guess, is you can kind of push it, uh, to create better scripts. Um, so, start production, I click start production, now it's generating these audio segments in parallel. It uses 11, 11 labs to go ahead and do that. I could see on the side that my my credits are are starting to, you know, drain. That cost about, you know, 40 cents or something like that. It uses, uh, a custom FFmpeg tool to actually stitch it together. Um, and yeah, hopefully it it creates something that's interesting. Uh, I I wonder if there's like a workflow that you can just run every single day to go ahead and create some of this. I'm sure, I'm sure there is. Um, but, you know, I'm not going to figure that out in this, in this episode. This is, this is for beginners. But, you know, you can imagine if this works, you're just going to want to have this on, on, on repeat, right? It creates this Facebook, sorry, it creates this faceless short form production engine that every single day you're getting content, uh, and creating followers, creating likes, etc. So, uh, it says retrieving pixel videos in in parallel, uh, and it's got seven on seven unique clips. Um, let's go ahead and continue. It says trimming all unique clips to audio length using make from assets V2. So it's creating the the video from the images. That's really the key with creating AI video is really the images, having great reference images, having great scripts. So you can see here it's already created it. And it's going to go ahead and stitch it together. Let's watch a couple of these. Let's see if we like it. In 2019, a broke developer named Tom had $47 in his bank account and a SaaS idea nobody wanted to fund. He couldn't afford Facebook ads, so he opened Reddit and found his first customer arguing in the comments of r/SaaS. Tom spent two hours every morning answering questions in five subreddits. No links, no pitches, just solving real problems. One comment got 2,000 upvotes. His inbox exploded with 89 people begging for his solution. He hadn't even built it yet. He coded for three weeks straight, launched with a simple post, and got 340 signups in 24 hours, all from Reddit. 12 months later, he had 4,000 paying customers. Reddit drove 67% of them. His CAC was literally zero. Today Tom's SaaS does 1.2 million in ARR. He still spends 30 minutes daily on Reddit because it works.

        "line": "So what did we do today? So what did we do today? We got the most out of Nano Banana with the Nano Banana Ultimate AI agent. We created a miniature AI documentary, really cool, and we didn't even research the script at all. We had Perplexity do it. We created an AI influencer. Uh, it did take eight minutes, but, come on, not not too bad. Uh, and then we created a story, a Reddit story, grabbed information from Reddit, uh, and created almost like stock footage with a audio on top of it that could be used to create audiences, uh, and share our stories. So, overall, I think it was really cool what we did today and, uh, kind of exceeded my expectations. I don't know about you. I think I'll end this episode by saying there's all these different agents and different categories, the video, image, the social media, uh, you know, if you want to create podcasts, you want to create a product influencer. And video and image, you know, V03 Master Prompter, you know, Kling 2.5. How do you create, you know, Hollywood special effects in your pockets? So there's a bunch of them here. Um, you can go ahead and create your own agents and your own workflows. Um, but, you know, it's really, in my opinion it's advanced. Like, I would use the regular agents to start, like before your creating these custom instructions, custom memories. But it's cool to see what you can do, right? You know, you can go and search X for, you know, a specific topic, and then it runs a deep research report, and then it creates, you know, text to image with flocks and so there's so much that you can do. But I would say, you know, from a beginner perspective, uh, play with agents. Um, see if you get something more out of, you know, the the creative AIs that exist. Um, you know, I think if if you, you know, if you've stuck around this long, you're seeing that a tool like Glif is helpful, right? Um, so, uh, hope this has been interesting to you. Hope it's gotten your creative juices flowing. And, uh, let me know what you want me to review next. Like, is there any tools that you think are interesting? Should I be doing more of this stuff? Uh, and, uh, you know, have a creative day, my friends. This is the greatest time in history to be building startups, to be building audiences, to be building communities. And I can't wait to see what you build next."

    "description": "Google might have just changed RAG forever with the latest update to the Gemini API. They have introduced the Gemini File Search tool, and it's effectively a managed RAG at a scale and price point that is absolutely disruptive. So, in this video, I'm going to go deeper into what this is, how it works, and why it's going to change how we build with AI forever.",

        "line": "All right, so I built this app using the latest Gemini API's file search tool, and I want to take you through the process and explain what really happens. So, here it requires an API key, which I've already selected. The option is for me to upload my own set of files, but I'm just going to use a Hyundai i10, which is a car manual. And I'm just going to say upload and chat."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "00:34",
        "line": "So, the moment I do that, the first step is semantic chunking, which is breaking down documents into meaningful paragraphs to understand the context. It is doing that for us. Second is document embedding, which is converting text into numerical vectors. Then the third piece is vector indexing, which is organizing text vectors into searchable maps for retrieval. Then you're doing layered retrieval, which is the next step after the the index has been done."

      {
        "timestamp": "00:57",
        "line": "So you already saw like the number of steps that it took, which was completely automated for us. And I did not actually set up this on a RAG system. This is the Gemini API's new file store tool doing it for us. Now, I can go ahead and ask a question. It's also suggesting a question that's pretty cool. So, where can I find information about troubleshooting a common error? Um, so what it is going to do is it is going to look into the document and provide a response. But the thing which I want to focus here is the sources, right? So this is the citation portion where it is behaving like a very typical RAG. But the beauty is I did not build the RAG system. All of this is embedded within the Gemini API. So a lot of the manual work that I would have had to do if I were using the end-to-end RAG process is now completely done by the API itself. And the best part is it is just an API call, right? So, let's get back and discuss how is it different from large language models and what is the progression. And we'll also look into some of the code as we progress."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "01:57",
        "line": "You know, large language models like Gemini are incredible. They can write poetry, debug code, and explain kind of complex topics in seconds. They have a vast knowledge of the world. But they have one fundamental blind spot. They know absolutely nothing about your world, your documents, your company's private data, and your project notes. It's all invisible to them. For developers, getting an AI to understand this specific private information has been a massive challenge."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "02:26",
        "line": "The main solution generally used to solve for this is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG. But building a RAG system yourself, well, that's been a complex, expensive, multi-stage engineering nightmare. It involves sourcing and chunking, which is breaking down your documents into perfectly sized chunks. Then creating embeddings, which is converting those chunks into numerical representations using a separate model. Then managing a vector database, which is setting up, managing, and paying for a specialized database to store and search these embeddings. And then building retrieval and ranking systems. Each of the steps that I just discussed is a massive engineering headache, or I should call this as infrastructure headache. It's a huge barrier that has kept this powerful technology out of hands of many developers like ourselves."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "04:07",
        "line": "So, that is where this file search tool is really, really awesome. How is it different? Let's try and understand that, right? It's not, is it going to kill RAG or something of that sort? Not really. File search itself is a RAG system. The key difference is that it hides all of that crazy complexity. It is a fully managed RAG system that automates the entire pipeline."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "04:29",
        "line": "If you look at this diagram, the process is actually broken into two key phases. First, there is an offline indexing process. This is where the heavy lifting happens. File Search uses a technique called semantic search to find information relevant to the user prompt. Unlike just matching keywords, it actually understands the meaning. When you upload a file, it's not just stored, it's automatically broken into chunks and converted into numerical representations, which we discussed earlier called embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of the text. These embeddings are then stored in that specialized database or file search store you see here. The whole flow from documents to embeddings to the database is that one-time indexing step. Then there is the real-time querying process. When a user asks a question, Gemini first decides if external knowledge would be helpful. If not, it just generates an answer. But if the answer is in your files, the yes path is taken. The model generates one or more optimized search queries. Those queries are also turned into embeddings and then used to search the database. The system finds the most relevant chunks of text, the context, and then feeds them back to the final Gemini model, which uses that context to generate a precise, grounded final answer. The entire sort of sophisticated loop that you're seeing here is what happens behind the scenes, completely managed for you by the Gemini API."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "05:56",
        "line": "Okay, so that's the theory aspect of it, but what makes it really game-changing is how simple is the code that you can use to implement this. It's really three steps, right? So the first one, here as you can see, you are creating the file store. The second step is where you are uploading and importing a file into that file search store. It's really a single API call that kicks off the entire offline indexing process, right? So that's pretty cool. And when I say the indexing process, it is all about the chunking, the embedding, everything handled automatically for you by the tool. You don't have to worry about it. And you can see that reflected in the code. And then the third piece is really the query piece, right? Which is the final call is really triggering the real-time querying process. You just point the model to your store using the tools and then it starts to generate the answer. It's just that simple, right? So from a mountain of complex engineering to just a few lines of code. And you can see there are multiple other options given for you to import the file, and then these are all the chunking and configuration which is automatically handled for you by the tool. You don't have to worry about it. This is the diagram that we just went through. So that the two processes I described. And then this is some additional information about how it kind of stores the metadata. All of this documentation is available, and I'm happy to share as well."

      {
        "timestamp": "07:09",
        "line": "There are a few other interesting things which it also does. One of the things which it does out of the box again is citations. So once you upload it, it is automatically able to provide citations just the way you look at the regular RAG, but again, this is automatically done for you, which is pretty cool. That is the code aspect of it if you want to implement it."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "07:27",
        "line": "So when you look at the code, you will feel that the code is pretty simple to implement, but the implications are massive. Let's talk about the three biggest breakthroughs this enables. Number one is the speed of development. As you can understand that this is accessible through the API, it is going to be significantly faster to develop this. Second is the critical one, which is the cost barrier, right? This is very interesting because the data storage is completely free. So the creating of the embeddings at query time, that is also free. You only pay a tiny one-time fee for indexing your files and the standard Gemini rates for the content used in the final answer."
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "08:02",
        "line": "And third, you don't sacrifice the power of simplicity. You still get support for dozens of file types out of the box. For years, the power to build AI that truly understands your private data was locked behind a huge wall of complexity and cost. With File Search, Google has just taken a sledgehammer to that wall."
