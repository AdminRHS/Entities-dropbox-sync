### Step 1: Initial Review (5 minutes)

**When Submission Received:**
1. Acknowledge receipt immediately
   - "Thank you for submitting RSH-006-05! I'll review it within 48 hours."
2. Download/access all submitted files
3. Quick scan to verify deliverables exist

**Check:**
- [ ] Gap Analysis document submitted
- [ ] Library Mapping Report submitted (if applicable)
- [ ] Files in correct location
- [ ] Files properly named

**If missing deliverables:** Ask employee to submit before proceeding

---

### Step 2: Completeness Assessment (10 minutes)

**Open:** Gap Analysis document and Library Mapping Report

**Score Completeness (40 points):**

**Gap Analysis (20 points):**

- [ ] Tools section complete with entries (7 pts)
- [ ] Workflows section complete with entries (7 pts)
- [ ] Cross-references to video/research source (3 pts)
- [ ] Integration recommendations provided (3 pts)

**Calculate Completeness Score:** ___ / 40 points

**Notes:**
- Missing sections = 0 points for that section
- Partial completion = 50% of points for that section
- Complete but minimal detail = 75% of points

---

### Step 3: Accuracy Verification (10 minutes)

**Calculate Accuracy Score:** ___ / 30 points

**Verification Method:**
1. Spot-check 3-5 tools/workflows mentioned
2. Verify in video transcription if unsure
3. Check LIBRARIES for duplicates
4. If major errors found, flag for revision

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Research is 90% complete but missing one section

**Solution:**
- Score as-is (will likely be 6-7/10)
- Approve but note missing section in feedback
- Integrate what's available
- Optional: Ask employee to complete missing section if critical

---

### Issue: Lots of duplicates with existing LIBRARIES

**Solution:**
- Not employee's fault (they may not know LIBRARIES well yet)
- Score based on effort and accuracy
- In feedback: "Good research! Most items already in LIBRARIES, which shows our knowledge is comprehensive. [#] new items identified - thank you!"
- Integration only new items

---

### Issue: Information is inaccurate or misunderstood

**Solution:**
- Score Accuracy section low (10-15/30 instead of 25-30)
- Request revision: "I noticed [specific inaccuracy]. Please review [source] and correct."
- If minor: Fix it yourself and note in feedback
- If major: Request revision

---

### Issue: Unclear if score is 4.9 or 5.1 (borderline)

**Solution:**
- Err on side of approval (5.1) if employee made genuine effort
- Use suggestions/feedback to guide improvement
- Reserve rejection for clearly incomplete work
- Remember: This is learning process, not perfection test

---

### Issue: First-time researcher, unfamiliar with format

**Solution:**
- Be generous with scoring (aim for 6-7/10 minimum)
- Provide detailed feedback with examples
- Offer to review work-in-progress next time
- Focus feedback on 2-3 specific improvements, not everything

---

## Integration with Tracking Files

### After Quality Review Complete:

**1. Update RESEARCH_ASSIGNMENT_LOG.md:**
- Change Status from "Review" to "Completed"
- Move to "Completed Assignments" archive section
- Add Quality Score and completion date

**2. Update EMPLOYEE_RESEARCH_HISTORY.md:**
- Add new row with assignment details
- Record quality score, time spent, outcome
- Update employee's average quality score

**3. Update RESEARCH_COMPLETION_TRACKER.md:**
- Increment completion count
- Update department progress
- Update gap closure status

**4. Update DEPARTMENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md:**
- Mark gap as "Partially Closed" or "Fully Closed"
- Note research ID that addressed it
- Update gap status

**5. Update WEEKLY_RESEARCH_PLAN.md:**
- Mark task complete
- Add notes on outcome

---

## Time Management

**Target Times:**
- Quick scan (completeness check): 5 minutes
- Detailed review: 20-30 minutes
- Feedback writing: 5-10 minutes
- Tracking updates: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 35-55 minutes per submission**

**For 2 submissions:** 70-110 minutes (1-2 hours Friday afternoon)

**Optimization Tips:**
1. Use review checklist template (saves 5-10 min)
2. Prepare feedback templates for common scores (saves 5 min)
3. Batch reviews (do all reviews Friday vs. spread through week)
4. Spot-check accuracy instead of verifying every item
5. Accept "good enough" (6+/10) instead of demanding perfection
