## 4. STRATEGIC GAPS ANALYSIS

### 4.1 LG Department Strategic Decision

**Critical Strategic Gap: In-House vs. Freelance Model**

**Current State:**
- 11 LG employees
- $5,000/month cost
- Declining appointments despite automation
- Performance concerns

**Gap:** No data-driven decision framework for in-house vs. freelance model

**Alternative Model (Freelance Platforms):**
- UpWork or CloudTask for lead research/data tasks
- Estimated cost: $2,000-$3,500/month (variable, performance-based)
- Potential savings: $1,500-$3,000/month ($18K-$36K annually)

**Action Required:**

1. **Collect Baseline Metrics (Week 1)**
   - Current LG performance:
     - Appointments per month
     - Lead quality (conversion rate)
     - Cost per appointment
     - Cost per closed deal
   - Document in spreadsheet

2. **Design Pilot Test (Week 2)**
   - Budget: $1,000-$2,000 for 1-month pilot
   - Platform: UpWork (start) or CloudTask
   - Scope: Hire 1-2 freelancers for lead research tasks
   - Success criteria:
     - Lead quantity (match or exceed in-house)
     - Lead quality (conversion rate >= in-house)
     - Cost per lead (<$5K/month total)

3. **Execute Pilot (Month 2)**
   - Post job on UpWork
   - Hire freelancers using vetting checklist
   - Track performance weekly
   - Compare to in-house LG metrics

4. **Evaluate Results (End of Month 2)**
   - Cost comparison: Freelance vs. in-house
   - Quality comparison: Lead conversion rates
   - Efficiency comparison: Leads per dollar spent
   - Control considerations: Loss of direct management

5. **Make Strategic Decision (Month 3)**
   - If freelance model performs equally or better at lower cost:
     - Consider phased transition (3-6 months)
     - Retain 1-2 in-house for oversight
     - Shift remaining to freelance model
   - If in-house model performs better:
     - Optimize current team (reduce to 6-8 employees?)
     - Focus on quality vs. quantity
   - Document decision rationale

**Owner:** HR + LG Department Lead + Leadership
**Timeline:** Month 1-3
**Potential Impact:** $18K-$36K annual savings

### 4.2 Sales Department SMM Support

**Strategic Gap: Sales Employee Time Allocation**

**Current State:**
- 1 Sales employee handling: Sales (33%) + SMM (33%) + Admin (33%)
- SMM quality potentially diluted
- Sales growth limited by competing priorities

**Gap:** No evaluation of SMM outsourcing ROI

**Alternative Model:**
- Hire part-time SMM via MarketerHire ($6K-$8K/month)
- Sales employee reallocates 10-15 hours/week to sales activities
- Potential revenue increase: If 1 additional client/month at $3-5K profit, ROI breaks even or positive

**Action Required:**

1. **Time Audit (Week 1)**
   - Track Sales employee time allocation for 2 weeks
   - Identify SMM tasks that could be outsourced
   - Calculate opportunity cost (sales time lost to SMM)

2. **ROI Calculation (Week 2)**
   - Current SMM time: X hours/week
   - MarketerHire cost: $6-8K/month (part-time)
   - Sales employee time freed: X hours/week
   - Revenue potential: How many additional clients could be closed with freed time?
   - Break-even analysis: Does 1 additional client/month justify cost?

3. **Decision (Week 3)**
   - If ROI positive: Research MarketerHire, interview specialists
   - If ROI negative: Optimize current model, consider Fiverr for one-off tasks
   - If uncertain: Pilot test with Fiverr for 1 month ($500-1,500) before MarketerHire commitment

**Owner:** Sales Department Manager + HR + Leadership
**Timeline:** Week 1-4
**Potential Impact:** Increased sales revenue or improved SMM quality

### 4.3 Design Department Overflow Management

**Strategic Gap: Peak Period Capacity Planning**

**Current State:**
- 9-person design team (largest department)
- Capacity issues during peak periods
- No formal overflow plan

**Gap:** No process for managing overflow design work

**Alternative Model:**
- Use 99designs for overflow ($300-$2K/project as needed)
- Alternative to hiring additional full-time designer ($3-5K/month fixed)

**Action Required:**

1. **Capacity Analysis (Week 1)**
   - Track design team capacity utilization (percentage booked)
   - Identify peak periods (client projects, deadlines)
   - Quantify overflow work (hours/projects turned down or delayed)

2. **Create Overflow Plan (Week 2)**
   - Trigger: When design team at 90%+ capacity
   - Platform: 99designs (contests for logos, marketplace for other work) or Fiverr (quick tasks)
   - Budget: Allocate $500-1,000/month for overflow (variable, as needed)
   - Process: Design lead approves overflow work, posts to platform, manages delivery

3. **Pilot Test (Month 2-3)**
   - Use 99designs or Fiverr for 1-2 overflow projects
   - Evaluate quality (matches in-house standards?)
   - Evaluate cost (vs. delays or hiring full-time)
   - Evaluate process (easy to manage?)

4. **Formalize (Month 4)**
   - If successful: Standardize overflow process, train design team
   - If unsuccessful: Re-evaluate capacity needs, consider full-time hire

**Owner:** Design Department Lead + HR
**Timeline:** Month 1-4
**Potential Impact:** No client delays, cost savings vs. full-time hire
