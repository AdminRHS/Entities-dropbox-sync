description: |
  Complete research lifecycle from Phase 0 weekly analysis to LIBRARIES integration.
  Cycles every Monday through Phase 0 analysis, driving continuous knowledge capture
  and gap closure. System self-sustains through weekly rhythm.

  Complete Cycle: Monday Phase 0 → Tuesday assignments → Following Tuesday submissions
  → Wednesday-Friday review/integration → Next Monday Phase 0 (with data - CYCLING)

  Time Investment: 6-7 hours/week (Research Manager) + 2-8 hours/week (2-4 employees)
  ROI: Knowledge accessible to all 29 employees across 8 departments

key_principle: |
  Phase 0 analysis every Monday is the ENGINE that drives the entire system.
  Without Monday Phase 0, system doesn't cycle. Protect this time.

    frequency: "Next Monday 9:00-10:30 AM"
    dependencies: ["Step 7 - Previous cycle complete"]

    significance: |
      THIS IS THE PROOF THAT THE SYSTEM CYCLES!

      The second Phase 0 analysis runs with REAL DATA:
      - Last week's completions (2 research tasks)
      - Quality scores (avg 7.5/10)
      - LIBRARIES growth (11 tools, 5 workflows added)
      - Gaps closed (2 partially closed)
      - Week-over-week comparison shows progress

      This validates the system cycles weekly and self-sustains.

    actions:
      - "Run Phase 0 analysis AGAIN (same process as Step 1)"
      - "Section 1: Last Week Review - NOW HAS DATA (completions, scores, LIBRARIES growth)"
      - "Section 2-7: Same as first Phase 0, but informed by previous results"
      - "Include Week-over-Week Comparison table showing progress"
      - "Identify NEW priorities based on what's been accomplished"
      - "Make NEW assignments for this week"
      - "Archive previous week's analysis to ANALYSIS_HISTORY/[YEAR]_[MONTH]/"

    inputs:
      - "Last week's completion data (Step 7 outputs)"
      - "Updated DEPARTMENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md (with closures)"
      - "Updated RESEARCH_COMPLETION_TRACKER.md (progress)"
      - "Previous week's analysis file (for comparison)"

    outputs:
      - "Second weekly analysis file with week-over-week comparison"
      - "New 2-4 assignment recommendations"
      - "Evidence of cycling: Progress visible week-over-week"
      - "CYCLING PROVEN ✅"

    success_criteria: |
      - Phase 0 runs successfully second time
      - Week-over-week comparison shows measurable progress
      - New priorities identified based on gaps closed
      - System demonstrated to cycle weekly
      - Confidence to scale (can repeat this every Monday)

    cycle_proof: |
      The cycle repeats weekly from this point:
      - Monday: Phase 0 → Tuesday: Assignments → Following Tuesday: Submissions
      - Wednesday-Friday: Review/Integration → Next Monday: Phase 0 (with more data)
      - Each cycle builds on previous, gaps close progressively, LIBRARIES grows
      - System self-sustains through Research Manager's Monday Phase 0 commitment

notes: |
  - This workflow creates a self-sustaining research system
  - The engine is Phase 0 - run it every Monday and the system thrives
  - System cycles weekly through Monday Phase 0 analysis
  - Knowledge continuously flows into LIBRARIES
  - Gaps close progressively over weeks/months
  - Employees contribute 1-2 hours/week (very manageable)
  - Research Manager invests 6-7 hours/week (sustainable)
  - ROI: Company-wide knowledge accessible to all 29 employees
