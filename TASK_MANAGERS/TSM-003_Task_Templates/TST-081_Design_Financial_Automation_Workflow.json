  "context": "to automate financial data processing, employee expense tracking, or accounting workflows using n8n or similar platforms",
  "description": "Comprehensive workflow design for automating financial processes such as employee data processing, expense tracking, invoice management, or payroll calculations. Uses workflow automation platforms (n8n, Zapier, Make) to connect data sources (Google Sheets, accounting software), transform data, and generate reports. Reduces manual financial operations and improves accuracy.",
