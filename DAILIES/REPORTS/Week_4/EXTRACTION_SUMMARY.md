## Recommendations for Week 4 Distribution

### High Priority Focus Areas
1. **AI Department:** 3 major projects in progress - ensure adequate resource allocation
2. **Design Department:** Largest team (4 employees) with diverse workload - monitor capacity
3. **Finance Department:** Architecture research complete - ready for implementation phase

### Resource Allocation
- **Most Active Departments:** Design (15 tasks), LeadGen (9 tasks), HR (6 tasks), Dev (6 tasks)
- **Highest Hours Logged:** Design (24.6 hrs), AI (16.0 hrs), HR (16.5 hrs)
- **Single-Person Departments:** Finance, Video, Sales - consider cross-training

### Project Continuity
- 4 active projects need Week 4 continuation (3 in AI, 1 in Lead Gen)
- Employee Dashboard migration completed - monitor deployment

### Team Distribution
- **4-person teams:** Design
- **3-person teams:** None
- **2-person teams:** AI, Dev, HR, Lead Gen
- **1-person teams:** Finance, Video, Sales

## Next Steps

1. **Review department CSVs** for individual task distribution
2. **Assign Week 4 priorities** based on project continuity needs
3. **Allocate resources** to active projects (especially AI department)
4. **Monitor single-person departments** for bottlenecks
5. **Update employee assignments** using generated CSVs
6. **Track project completion** for the 4 in-progress initiatives
