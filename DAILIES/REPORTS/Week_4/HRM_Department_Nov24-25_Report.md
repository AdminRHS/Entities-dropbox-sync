## REKONVALD VIKTORIYA - HR AUTOMATION SPECIALIST

### November 24, 2025 - Comprehensive Daily Report

#### Morning Session: Task Manager Statistics Fix (09:00-12:00)

**TST-017: Fix Task Manager Statistics Detection Algorithm**
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Time:** 09:00-12:00 (3 hours)
**Department:** HRM

**Description:**
Major overhaul of task completion detection algorithm to improve accuracy from 60% to 85% through enhanced parsing logic and handling of file structure variations.

**Context:**
Day 23 report revealed significant issues with task detection accuracy due to variations in how employees format their markdown files. This work addresses those structural inconsistencies.

**Detailed Steps Completed:**

1. **STT-047: Review Day 23 Report and Identify Issues**
   - Analyzed failed detection cases from previous day
   - Documented patterns of missed tasks
   - Identified root causes (checkbox format variations, heading structures)
   - Categorized issues by type
   - **Outcome:** Clear problem statement and scope

2. **STT-048: Analyze File Structure Variations Across Employee Folders**
   - Examined task.md files from 5+ employees
   - Documented format variations:
     - Different checkbox syntaxes: `[x]`, `[X]`, `✓`, `✅`
     - Inconsistent heading levels (##, ###, ####)
     - Varying task description formats
     - Different indentation styles
   - **Outcome:** Comprehensive variation catalog

3. **STT-049: Develop Improved Parsing Logic**
   - Created regex patterns to match all checkbox variations
   - Implemented flexible heading detection
   - Added smart indentation handling
   - Built fallback detection mechanisms
   - **Outcome:** Robust parsing algorithm

4. **STT-050: Test with Nealova Evgeniya's Data**
   - Ran new algorithm on Nealova's Week_4 data
   - Compared detection with manual count
   - Verified accuracy improvement
   - Identified remaining edge cases
   - **Outcome:** 85% accuracy confirmed

5. **STT-051: Refine Heading Detection for Format Variations**
   - Added support for non-standard heading formats
   - Implemented context-aware heading detection
   - Created heading hierarchy parsing
   - **Outcome:** Heading detection reliability improved

**Technical Implementation:**

**Before (60% accuracy):**
```python
# Simple regex - missed many variations
task_pattern = r'\[x\]'
```

**After (85% accuracy):**
```python
# Comprehensive detection
checkbox_patterns = [
    r'\[x\]', r'\[X\]',
    r'✓', r'✅', r'☑',
    r'\* \[x\]', r'- \[x\]'
]
# Plus context-aware validation
```

**Outcomes Achieved:**
- ✅ Accuracy improved from ~60% to ~85% (+25% improvement)
- ✅ Enhanced checkbox format detection handles multiple formats
- ✅ Edge cases documented for future reference
- ✅ Need for standardized task marking identified

**Tools Used:**
- **TOL-XXX:** Python - Algorithm development
- **TOL-XXX:** VS Code - Code editing
