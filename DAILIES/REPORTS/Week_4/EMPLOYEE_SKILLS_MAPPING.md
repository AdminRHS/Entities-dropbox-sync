**Generated:** 2025-11-28
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-28 (Imported skills from research transcriptions)
**Source:** Week_4 Reports (DGN, HRM, FIN) + Skills Taxonomy (SKL-XXX) + Research Transcriptions
**Purpose:** Map employees to standardized skill IDs from TALENTS/Skills catalog

**Updates:**
- ✅ Removed SKL-NEW-06 (Python algorithms) and SKL-NEW-13 (immigration research) per user feedback
- ✅ Imported existing skills from research transcriptions (Video_017/018 Midjourney, Video_023 Google AI Studio)
- ✅ Assigned Midjourney advanced skills (SKL-053 to SKL-057) to designers using AI tools
- ✅ Assigned Google AI Studio skills (SKL-062, SKL-064) to content creators
- ✅ Assigned lead generation/scraping skills (SKL-014) to marketers
- **Final Count:** 65 existing skills + 23 new skills = 88 total skills mapped

## MAPPING METHODOLOGY

**From Reports → Skills Taxonomy:**
1. Extract actual work performed from employee reports
2. Match work activities to existing SKL-XXX skills
3. Identify skills NOT in taxonomy (propose new SKL-XXX)
4. Assign proficiency levels based on documented performance
5. Link to evidence (task completions, deliverables)

**Skill Formula:** Skill = Action + Object + Tool
- Example: "developed features in React" = SKL-030
