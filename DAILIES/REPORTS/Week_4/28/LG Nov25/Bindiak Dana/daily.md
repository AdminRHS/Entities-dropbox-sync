**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Well, and there will be one more around three o’clock or so. Hopefully Stas will take it. Or I’m going to sleep. But I hope I’ll wake up, though not guaranteed.

Alright, and will someone pick me up at eleven o’clock or not? So I know what to do.

Yes, one. One will come to you. Yeah. The second one didn’t want the same thing, she wanted video editing instead, so just one girl — and God willing, she’ll show up. So it would’ve been better to postpone it, of course, but maybe even one will come.

But as I understood, on Monday they will bring out everyone. That workshop you mentioned, right?

No, I think someone will be doing onboardings now. We need to sort through all the materials we have. The websites need to be sorted out. It’s the end of the year, today’s Friday, end of the week. We need to finish all the pending tasks.

These Black Friday postings — distribute the tasks among people: who posts what, where, how, and get yourselves together to actually do it.

Yes, we already did that, we posted everything yesterday. And did anyone get any reactions anywhere?

Let’s go. I have 1200 accounts on my list. How many accounts can we post to? Come on, let’s increase the number of accounts per person.

How many are they doing now? Three? The promised three. Well, double that. Split them up, let them post and check the old messages at the same time.

Alright, got it, and keep increasing. Two days passed — add two more accounts. For now, we’re not thinking about automation.

Take the file from Ksenia, the one I uploaded whenever it showed up. The task list for today is there.

It’s not the freshest yet, but if you need it, check below.

So what are your plans then? What’s best to focus on? What about the weak ones?

And what about the new ones — the ones we’re finishing? The onboarding there is still questionable.

No, well, today I gave them the job site. They started normally, of course, but I think they haven’t seen us and think we’re busy.

They both are active. Yes, it’s the end of the month, I need to wrap things up.

But they had enough leads at the beginning, meaning their results are still accumulating. Then you can give them accounts for one repost each.

We give them one each — inbound leads. Their barbecue is on Thursday and Wednesday. Aquarius account is by hour. We have a REMS website for immigrants, and it’s extremely outdated. Ridiculously outdated. There is even a Leadgen page on the REMS website that is also extremely old. We talked about this.

Through our institute, we can slowly make a plan on Dropbox. If we aren’t onboarding new people and next month we focus on putting everything in order, what do we need to fix? Probably start with the website? Yes. We need to close a lot of unnecessary stuff there.

On the REMS website, only the professions you want to sell should remain. And those that nobody ever asks for should be removed. Someone opens the page, and there’s some German teacher or something else. I saw it. I checked — it’s a mess. We need designers.

Today Villy will show them, we’ll test how to run a skill-up session, how to make images, and then we’ll try writing posts with them. But of course, we also need to prepare for additional leads, write some more things.

Please check who still has yellow cards — who didn’t record anything yesterday. There are twenty people — who from Leadgen ended up in the admin chat above us? Ulvia, Plamena, Joy — all Leadgen. They all need a warning.

Okay, yesterday we posted a reminder for them to pay attention, record everything with Whisper, and write more detailed notes, but we need to repeat it. We had a channel called “carpet” before. So call them on the carpet — have a disciplinary talk.

Okay, Plamena works for us; project ones we don’t keep for now. Yes, only actual working hours. I’m already updating their skills, and from those who wrote, I’m updating the employee portfolio profiles. So that’s super important.

Each of you pick one person to question and ask why it’s like that, okay? Good. Then you can sit here or leave, as you like.

Alright, we’ll go check the yellow cards, ask questions to the others. And you’ll manage the accounts too, right? Yes. And the control spreadsheet — who took what, where it is, how things are.

Yes, we already have a spreadsheet for assigning accounts, and we keep it updated: who has one, who doesn’t, when they return it — we log everything. OK.

Great, and… oh, a big update for you. Yesterday we sat with Victoria, and she made her Telegram respond through the JPK agent — we tested JPK agent. Yes, yes, I even brought cheesecake as a treat.

She says it replies to 30 people in a single run, with a single prompt. If we can use this for lead generation — instead of opening eight windows, launching eight processes — this agent sends 30 each. That would be fantastic. Please test this, record your findings, and write a report: how it worked, what impressions you had. And send it in writing? Yes, yes, go ahead.

**Outcomes:**
- Managers reminded to update daily reports accurately
- Plan set to distribute more accounts to lead generation managers
- Immediate issues identified for follow-up after meeting

### 10:00-10:30 - Day planning
**What I worked on:**
- Rescheduled the day's tasks to accommodate new priorities
- Checked dependencies to ensure updates fit the timeline
- Communicated adjusted plan to stakeholders

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

What are we worried about? It doesn’t record. I think what it detects is some suspicious activity — like when you open pages too fast, and it shows a warning that you might be using some automated tools. But they told us to try it, so we need to try it and provide some kind of result.

So I think let’s do this: we’ll call those “hard-workers” in now and tell them about their tough fate. And what do you need to tell them? Look, regarding Ulviya — first, we need to ask her and check if she’s saving those files. Because she already had the same issue when Zhenya checked her work. Ksyusha asked her to share her screen, and it turned out everything was written, she just didn’t save anything, so nothing appeared on our side.

If it really doesn’t record for her — then we’ll push her to fix it and make sure it records. About Isaac, I’m not sure. Just remind him again. From what I understand, Kolya already told him, if he was there. Yes, he did, but Isaac didn’t find any specific reason why he wasn’t doing it. Okay, then remind Isaac gently one more time. And Jo — she needs things hammered into her head, so she actually does it.

Everyone will share their screen, and we’ll see what’s going on. Yes, let them show their own screen. Maybe they really aren’t saving things. Earlier everything saved automatically, but now when I upload a script, that little dot appears — meaning I need to save manually. It’s not that hard to press Ctrl+S. For the 12:00 session, they all must turn on WhisperFlow and record it properly. If they don’t have WhisperFlow — then we’ll push them to install it, period.

And one more thing I wanted to clarify: what about Cynthia, Anivazy — is she still working with us? Who is that? Well, it’s Chikodi. Oh right. I had a call with him when I booked the meeting. He wrote that he doesn’t remember any agreement and that he doesn’t even work in that company anymore. He said he doesn’t understand how we got his contact at all.

Look, she (Chikodi) said he wanted the meeting, but she didn’t have access to his CRM card. He already had a card. I gave her that card — maybe he’s working for another company now, because that card was from 2022 or something. Right, he doesn’t remember any meeting and thinks the message was sent to him by mistake.

Okay, then we need to bring Chikodi here now and let her show us the conversation with him.

I’ll tell you what happened: my power went out. I was talking to Nastya about how Chikodi scheduled that meeting, and the lead said it couldn’t be true. I think he got confused because of the booking email we send. Maybe he already works in another company, and the CRM still had his old company in his card. He doesn’t understand the reason for the call — but that happens to us often. Sometimes two companies are shown for the same lead.

What we must do today is check the newcomers’ cards — who is assigned to whom. Remind Ulviya to check hers. Donessa probably has only one card anyway, if she even has one.

We’ll also check ours. And as punishment: Stasha didn’t fill in the files properly, right? Yes. So we’ll review the cards. We already dealt with the file issue.

At 12:00 we have a training session with the designer, and we need to record it on Loom. Will you do it? Yes, I will. I hope it records normally with sound.

Then I want to check Cynthia’s / Chikodi’s cards, because when we reviewed them with Ksyusha, everything was fine except the statuses. I’ll review a few of her flows again. She’s good, but a bit inattentive. That issue with the lead — yeah, that’s concerning.

Honestly, I’m not very angry at her, because it’s her first time messing something up. You know yourself — until you screw something up, you don’t learn. What matters is that she fixes it. I’m not angry, I’m just… irritated.

Next, after all this, they still have to share their cards. After the training session. And we also have onboarding, but right now they’re doing job-site tasks, right? Yes, they are. And we’re taking them to the 12:00 session too? Of course, let them watch.

They go to the 12:00 session, then lunch at 1, then come back at 2, do the Google scraping task until 5. What time are you going to lunch? You said you were leaving?

I’m going at 1 for sure. I’ll be back around 2 or 3 and finish the last three hours. Can I go at 2 instead? Or do I have to go with everyone? You can go at 2, no problem. We’ll just tell them to come at 2.

Should we send them the call-booking course beforehand? For when I’m at lunch. I already told them everything. First, that course doesn’t exist, and second, I already explained everything.

Okay, then let them do Google scraping while you’re away. Yes, I showed them how call booking works, how the client conversation looks, what we need to do. I sent them the starter pack. I showed everything visually and told them that when they have their first call, they message their buddy and book it together step by step.

Perfect. I knew you’d manage. After that… I don’t know how long this design training will last. Probably long. Yeah, I think so too. We’ll see.

Anyway, I’m not planning anything else before lunch. After lunch… well, I don’t really want to do it, but we need to take a small account and test this agent. And if it behaves like crap, we’ll write exactly that in the report — that it’s unreliable and dangerous for LinkedIn.

Yes, you should test it. And we also need to give one account to each newcomer so they can post content. Let them repost and publish posts. But we need to monitor that.

We need to make a table where you write who got which account for next week, and then collect them back at the end. Yes, create a table and record everything. And let them publish and repost. Do I create another variation of yesterday’s post? I think we shouldn’t write it in the group — better send each of them a personal message.

I’ll write a small announcement anyway so they know to track their account activity, and that we’ll take the accounts back at the end of the week. Yes, and tell them not to work from those accounts — just repost and post. For example, Isaac or Chikodi. I think that account will be fine.

But don’t give freedom to Joy. No, no, no — I’ll write clearly: do not work from this account. Only repost and publish. Let them do it today. Yes, yes, yes. So that we can show some results. I think we can even give 2 accounts to people like Isaac. He said not one but double the number.

Okay, today we’ll give only one account to the weaker ones.

- Updated plan confirmed for the day

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Sorry I might ask some very funny questions. Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay. So my first question is I know we're supposed to create three three files on each day daily plans and tasks. Yeah. So my question is is there a template for daily like there's a template that we just need to fill out or just write on our own? The same thing plans and for task? Because I copied these ones from someone else's report but I just wanted to be sure and it looks ... week one. Week one, yeah. And open, for example, folder O5. O5, yeah. Open daily. And here you can see the template. If you want to use it, you can just copy and paste it every day in your files. I do that actually. Or you can ask the Cloud AI inside Visual Code to fill out the plans with the same structure. For example I usually write in chat in VS Code please fill out my files in folder 28 as today for example with the same structure as in file O5 for example. Okay. How do you integrate it? I've been trying to do that with Claude but it's not working? That is because you have to write correct path for program because that is a robot that can recognize without your clues right so I can send you I yesterday shared it with the girls and I can send you an example okay for example like this I'll send you in private message I sent this to the Claude or chat in inside the Visual Code and just change the names of folders because you see it's not like independent folders in the VS Code right they are all in a folder November then we have folder for weeks week one week two and so on and inside these folders we have folders with dates and inside folders with dates we have these files. Okay. So how do I use Claude for that? Do I go here? I've tried it so many times. It keeps showing me... Press Cloud AI subscription. Open but open this in LG account on Google Chrome. Okay. So do I need to copy? I think it's better to use button open but again you have to open this in LG account. Oh wait wait Isaac I remember you had problems with the Claude. I remember. Sorry I forgot about that. Okay close this and let's try to install the chat. Please can you press on extension mark extension icon in your Visual Code. It's left side you see here folders like search and the last one yeah extensions good. Okay please write codex in the search line I will text you in the chat. Codex okay. But let me... That's the first one. Press Install. Trust. But clean the search line because they put your transcription in the search line. Okay. Now you can close it and close the Claude. Yes. And this one you can also close. Okay. And now under the extension I always forget this word... yeah yeah uh under you can see the button yeah of codecs. Try to press OK sign in with ChatGPT but again we have to open this in LG account. Okay so with Google yes right I think it's loading it's loading yeah you're right. Continue okay signing to codecs. Okay let's try back to Visual Code. Yeah good so you can paste your request for example and use it at daily basis. I use an extension model use existing existing model. Yeah you're ready. Okay so I'll just tell you what to do and you're going to run it. Okay? You can write for example "I don't have the structure for today only in plans" in a Markdown file right? Yes yes or 28. I don't have um okay. Let's write in the chat here I mean in Visual Code a fill out a file daily.md in a folder. Okay? In a folder week 4, name and surname. Okay? With the same structure as in file daily.md and now you can copy this in folder 28 in folder week 4 in folder Isaac Archibald. To not write it again okay? Paste it and just change the numbers. Okay? So I can send right uh did you copy no no no no way uh. So yeah please copy in folder 28 in folder week 4 in folder Isaac Archibald. No no no don't write I ask you to copy okay? Everything that I've written right yes but not everything just the starting from in folder. Okay? And end with Isaac Archibald like this. Yeah paste it and change. I should paste or copy a copy and then paste after the end. I mean


**Outcomes:**
- Managers understood Dropbox usage and folder structure
- Reporting expectations clarified for daily files

### 15:30-16:30 - Messaging test results
**What I worked on:**
- Discussed initial results from testing the new method for messaging old connections
- Collected feedback on response rates and any delivery issues
- Outlined next adjustments to improve the messaging flow

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

And the account didn’t get blocked, right?

No, not yet. You see, the funny thing is: I thought it would get blocked. I googled what this tool even is, how it filters things for LinkedIn, and people said that most likely everything would get blocked. It does work, but there’s one “but.”

So, I turned on the tempo on purpose so you can understand the working speed — kind of like a real person. Don’t rush, slower. Don’t you see how our managers type line by line?

Got it, got it. So, look at the name — it’s writing to Antonova now. Can you see it or not?

No, I don’t see anything, honestly, but I trust you.

Okay. It wrote: “Hi Antonio, hope you well.” Basically the message is the same, right?

Okay, why is it slowing down?

It’s not slowing down, it’s sending to Elisa now — same thing: “Hi Elisa.” Then it went on to the next one, and it actually sped up a bit, like it was working slower before. Now it’s continuing.

So yeah, it works. I can explain to someone how to use it. The only thing is, when we write the instructions… by the way, it adjusts stuff for everyone on this account, not for everyone overall.

Anyway, the point is: it won’t log in immediately, because it needs verification. When we open LinkedIn, it doesn’t sign into Google — it has its own internal browser. It won’t switch accounts in Google at all.

So no matter what, we log into LinkedIn with login and password, and then we also need to open that same profile on the side, because the verification code will come there.

And I don’t know, something in the code needs fixing, because this time I received three codes. It’s not a big problem — we have access to everything — but I’m just curious how long it will survive. Maybe skip a couple of sessions so the accounts don’t get restricted, because these accounts are… well, it’s bad if they get blocked, but not tragic. But the older, well-developed accounts — that’s scary.

There are issues with that, yes. They can get blocked, absolutely.

And look, there’s another thing: I logged in under one IP — the IP of this internal browser, this session. Do you understand what an IP is?

I don’t know how Agent Mode handles it. Most likely it uses some random connection. So if I launch the same session another time, LinkedIn might see that the login is from a different device.

That could cause big problems or small problems, but most likely if we log into one account two or three times from different IPs, a block will pop up.

So yeah, that’s why I’m saying — even if it works once, it’s still risky to use it on important accounts.

But look, as I understand, this is a one-time thing anyway. We don’t send follow-ups every day, right? It’s a test run. Usually we write them manually three days a week for each account.

And the tool basically does the same thing you do manually.

Yeah, just slower, much slower.

Anyway, okay, tell me. Honestly, nothing special happened. I realized that it works, and actually works pretty well for the first try.

How it will behave later — no one can predict. We assume it will probably get the account blocked. Who knows.

Okay, on Monday I’ll try the same thing again. On this same account.

Now I’ll sit and wait, watch it, maybe it’ll block the session on its own. I’ll sit and let it send everything, maybe.

If it runs through the whole list. I don’t know how many people, 10–100–1000? There are only 300 from six months ago, so it should finish quickly. But it didn’t include the ones who had fewer… So it doesn’t run through all? Just so that this account can be launched again and we can see how it behaves.

Alright, okay, I’ll wait a bit. I don’t know, I didn’t set the counter, but I’ll watch it. Right now I like that it’s running at least.

What broke? Oh, it clicked something randomly — it went back to the message it just wrote. Now it’s fine again, moving through the list.

Apparently it checks where it started. Anyway, I don’t really like that it’s slow, but the big advantage is that you can keep it running in the background. It works here, and you can do other tasks.

Yeah, you do some other work. It will keep running until the tokens run out. How much time do we have on this agent?

Well, I’ll test it today. I’ll sit for like 30 minutes, track how long it works, and then I’ll tell you.

Okay, good. Just leave yourself some people for a second test — to see how it behaves on the same account.

Thanks, thanks. Alright, thank you very much. I’ll send you everything I uploaded.

Thanks, thanks for everything. If you need me, I’m here. Alright, thanks for the call. I did everything. No need anymore — everything finally works now.
