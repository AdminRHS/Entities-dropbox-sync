## Today's Review ## ##
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Wrapped up reviewing and concluding the current batch of companies from job sites, then got allocated a fresh set to work with for the next phase.  
- Had a solid meeting with the Design team where they walked us through how to create social media post designs for all our Remote Helpers accounts using ChatGPT.  
- Set up a dedicated ChatGPT workspace for design work by uploading an existing template that'll serve as the go-to reference for all future designs we create.  
- Synced everything to Dropbox so the admin can see all my updates and stay in the loop on what's being done.  
- Tested out 2 different versions of Black Friday messages across 2 separate LinkedIn accounts that were assigned to me for this campaign.

## Prioritized Action Items ## ##


### High Priority ## ###
1. **Track and optimize Black Friday message performance on LinkedIn**
   - Goal: Keep a close eye on how the 2 Black Friday message variations are performing across the 2 assigned LinkedIn accounts and see which one resonates better with prospects.  
   - Expected outcome: Get solid data on which message variant works best so we can double down on that approach and replicate it for future seasonal campaigns.  
   - Deadline: Initial check-in by tomorrow, then keep monitoring as Black Friday progresses.

2. **Process newly allocated job site companies**
   - Goal: Start working through the new batch of companies we got from job sites to qualify them and get them ready for outreach.  
   - Expected outcome: Have a clean list of relevant companies organized with notes and status updates so we're ready to move forward with targeted campaigns.  
   - Deadline: Make solid progress by end of tomorrow.


### Medium Priority ## ###
1. **Integrate new social media design workflow using ChatGPT**
   - Goal: Start using the ChatGPT workspace and template we set up today to pump out quality social media designs for Remote Helpers across all our accounts.  
   - Expected outcome: Faster turnaround on content creation with a consistent look and feel that matches our brand, plus templates we can reuse and adapt quickly.  
   - Deadline: Start applying this in the next few days as new content needs come up.

2. **Keep Dropbox synced and organized**
   - Goal: Make sure everything we're working on stays updated in Dropbox so the admin always knows what's happening and can review our progress anytime.  
   - Expected outcome: Transparent workflow where nothing gets lost and the admin has full visibility into deliverables and daily updates.  
   - Deadline: Every day, keep it updated.


### Low Priority ## ###
1. **Build out the design template library**
   - Goal: Gradually add more templates and variations to our ChatGPT workspace for different content types like announcements, case studies, and promotions.  
   - Expected outcome: A bigger toolkit that lets us create designs faster and keeps everything looking professional and on-brand.  
   - Deadline: Add to it whenever we have spare time.

2. **Refine the Black Friday messaging approach**
   - Goal: Once we see how the initial Black Friday messages perform, tweak things like tone, structure, or hooks to make them even more effective.  
   - Expected outcome: A messaging framework that's sharper and hits better with prospects, improving our reply rates over time.  
   - Deadline: After we collect enough data from the current tests, probably within the week.
