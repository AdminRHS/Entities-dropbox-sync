## Today's Review ## ##
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Yesterday we sent out 5 versions of Black Friday messages on LinkedIn, so today I need to see which one is getting better responses and keep pushing that one.  
- Got a fresh stack of companies from job sites to work through, need to research them and get them ready for outreach.  
- Set up that ChatGPT workspace for designs yesterday, so today I'm gonna use it to make some posts for our social media accounts.  
- Gotta keep syncing everything to Dropbox so the admin can see what I'm working on and track progress.  
- Plan is to get some quick wins today on the Black Friday campaign and move through as many company qualifications as I can.

## Prioritized Action Items ## ##


### High Priority ## ###
1. **Check how the Black Friday messages are performing**
   - Goal: Pull the engagement numbers from yesterday's Black Friday messages on both LinkedIn accounts and see which version is getting more replies and opens.  
   - Expected outcome: I'll know which message is actually working better so I can focus on that one and stop wasting time on the weaker version.  
   - Deadline: Get the data by morning, then start scaling the winner by afternoon.

2. **Work through and qualify the new companies**
   - Goal: Take the batch of companies from job sites and do some quick research on each one. Check out their LinkedIn, website, figure out who the right person to contact is, and add notes about whether they're a good fit.  
   - Expected outcome: Have a solid list of maybe 15-20 companies that are actually worth reaching out to, with all the info I need to personalize my messages.  
   - Deadline: Get at least 10 companies done by end of day.


### Medium Priority ## ###
1. **Design some social media posts with the new template**
   - Goal: Use the ChatGPT workspace we set up to make 3-4 posts for our Remote Helpers social accounts. Mix it up with some company updates, service highlights, that kind of thing.  
   - Expected outcome: Have a few solid posts ready to go that look professional and on-brand, ready to schedule and publish whenever we need them.  
   - Deadline: Get them done and uploaded to Dropbox by end of day.

2. **Tweak the Black Friday messages based on what we learn**
   - Goal: Once I see which Black Friday message is doing better, I'll take what's working and make the losing one better. Maybe change up the hook or make the CTA clearer.  
   - Expected outcome: A stronger version of the Black Friday message that we can use for the rest of the campaign.  
   - Deadline: Have the improved version ready by late afternoon.

3. **Sync everything to Dropbox**
   - Goal: Make sure I'm uploading all my work as I go through the day so the admin can see what's getting done. New companies list, designs, message updates, everything.  
   - Expected outcome: The admin can check Dropbox anytime and see exactly what I've been working on and what's complete.  
   - Deadline: Final upload at end of day.


### Low Priority ## ###
1. **Add more design templates to the workspace**
   - Goal: If I have some spare time, add a couple more template options to the ChatGPT workspace so we have more variety when we're making designs.  
   - Expected outcome: More templates means faster design work in the future and more options to play with.  
   - Deadline: Do it if I get a chance, no big rush.

2. **Look up what other companies are doing with Black Friday outreach**
   - Goal: Spend some time checking out how other companies are running their Black Friday LinkedIn campaigns, see if there's anything we're missing or could be doing better.  
   - Expected outcome: Some ideas we can steal or improve on for future campaigns.  
   - Deadline: Jot down some notes by end of day if time allows.

## Goals and Objectives ## ##
- Figure out which Black Friday message actually works and lean hard into it instead of spreading myself thin.  
- Build up a real list of qualified companies we can actually reach out to and get responses from.  
- Get comfortable using the new ChatGPT design system and prove it actually saves us time.  
- Keep the admin in the loop with regular Dropbox updates so there's no confusion about what's getting done.  
- Keep things moving forward on both the Black Friday push and building out our company pipeline.  
- Get some solid momentum going so we can keep this pace up.

## Expected Outcomes ## ##
- Clear answer on which Black Friday message is working better, so we're not guessing anymore.  
- A list of 15-20 companies we actually want to reach out to with all the research done and ready to go.  
- A few quality social media posts that look good and are ready to publish.  
- A better version of the Black Friday message that should get more responses.  
- Admin can see everything we've done in Dropbox without having to ask questions.  
- More momentum and better data to work with as we head into the rest of the Black Friday season.  
- Setting ourselves up to keep scaling what's working without wasting time on what isn't.
