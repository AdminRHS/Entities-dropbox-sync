## Today's Review
**Based on yesterday's daily.md analysis:**

**Completed Tasks:**
- A new batch of raw companies was collected for the Google Maps project.
- The processing of 1500 job site companies was completed.
- The "Gem" custom chat successfully passed user testing with Dana.
- A performance diagnostic of the Google Maps script was conducted.

**Incomplete/Blocked Tasks:**
- The main batch of 70k+ job vacancies is still in the processing pipeline. This remains the primary production task.

**Key Insights:**
- The production pipelines are stable and running. The main bottleneck is simply the time it takes to process such a large volume of data.
- There is a clear need for more automation in the lead generation process itself, beyond just data collection and analysis.
