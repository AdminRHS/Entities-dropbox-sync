## Mapping Rules Applied

Tasks were mapped to projects based on:

1. **Department Default:** Each department has a primary project
2. **Keyword Matching:** Task descriptions matched against project keywords
3. **Section Context:** Task section headers analyzed for relevance

### Department-to-Project Defaults

| Department | Default Project |
|------------|------------------|
| AI | PRT-001: AI Tutorial Research to Taxonomy Integration |
| Design | PRT-008: VIDEO |
| Dev | PRT-002: Complete MCP Automation Stack Setup |
| Fin | PRT-007: System Analysis |
| HR | PRT-003: Complete HR Automation Implementation |
| LG | PRT-004: Complete Lead Generation to Customer Conversion Campaign |

## Next Steps

1. **Milestone Linking:** Map tasks to MLT-### milestones within projects
2. **Tool Association:** Identify TOL-### tools used in each task
3. **Guide References:** Link to GDS-### guides for task execution
4. **Department Reports:** Generate PMT-033 to PMT-043 reports with mapped data
5. **Aggregation:** Combine using PMT-032 for cross-project insights
