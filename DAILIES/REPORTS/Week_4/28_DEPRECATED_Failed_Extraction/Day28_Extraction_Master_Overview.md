1. **Use checkbox format** for better task extraction:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Task to do
   - [X] Task completed
   - [~] Task in progress
   ```

2. **Include time stamps** for temporal tracking:
   ```markdown
   ### 9:00-11:00 - Activity Name
   - Task details
   ```

3. **Complete all 3 files** (daily.md, plans.md, task.md) for comprehensive tracking

4. **Use status markers** (✅🔄🆕⏸️) for clear task state indication

### For System Enhancement

1. **Improve extraction for narrative content** (like Fin department)
2. **Add time estimate extraction** from task descriptions
3. **Detect dependencies** between tasks
4. **Extract tool mentions** automatically
5. **Link related tasks** across employees
