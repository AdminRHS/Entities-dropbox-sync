## 📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

### Time Budget (Day 28)
| Task | Priority | Time | Running Total |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| TASK-VID-006: AI compliance | 🔴 Critical | 1h | 1h |
| TASK-VID-007: Video interview production | 🔴 Critical | 4-6h | 5-7h |
| TASK-VID-008: Animation production | 🔴 Critical | 2-3h | 7-10h |
| TASK-VID-009: Portfolio updates | 🟡 Medium | 1.5h | 8.5-11.5h |

3. 🔴 TASK-VID-008 (Animation production - client projects)
4. 🔴 TASK-VID-011 (Media channel - daily requirement)
5. 🟡 TASK-VID-009 (Portfolio - can defer to Day 29)
6. 🟡 TASK-VID-010 (AI dept files - can defer if not immediately blocking)

- Automation opportunities identified (which steps can be automated?)
- Improved video production efficiency through better tools

---

#### Potential Executive Assignment #3: Daily Documentation Process Champion
**Rationale:**
