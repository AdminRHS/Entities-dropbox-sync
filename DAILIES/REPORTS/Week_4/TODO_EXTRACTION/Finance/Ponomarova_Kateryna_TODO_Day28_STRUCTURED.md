## 📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

### Time Budget (Day 28)
| Task | Priority | Time | Running Total |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| TASK-FIN-001: Darya birthday | 🔴 Critical | 1h | 1h |
| TASK-FIN-003: AI compliance Days 24-25 | 🔴 Critical | 1.5h | 2.5h |
| TASK-FIN-002: October bonus table | 🔴 Critical | 2-3h | 4.5-5.5h |
| TASK-FIN-006: Time-off tracking (3x) | 🔴 Critical | 0.5h | 5-6h |
| TASK-FIN-007: Calls calendar (3x) | 🔴 Critical | 0.25h | 5.25-6.25h |
| TASK-FIN-004: GPT accounts audit | 🟡 High | 2h | 7.25-8.25h |
| TASK-FIN-005: Design budget | 🟡 Medium | 1h | 8.25-9.25h |
| TASK-FIN-008: Financial docs for Stas | 🟡 Medium | 1h | 9.25-10.25h |
| TASK-FIN-009: Daily AI research | 🟡 High | 0.5h | 9.75-10.75h |
| **Total Planned** | | **10-11h** | **Over capacity** |

### Capacity Analysis
**Realistic Assessment:**
- Day 28 over-allocated (10-11h planned for 8h day)
- October bonus table may take full 2-3h (Klymenko verification, all departments)
- Time-off and calls tracking are daily essentials (non-negotiable)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Morning priority:** Darya birthday (1h) + AI compliance (1.5h) = 2.5h
2. **Core work:** October bonus table (2-3h) + Time-off/calls tracking (0.75h) = 2.75-3.75h
3. **Defer if needed:** Design budget (TASK-FIN-005) can extend to Day 29
4. **Defer if needed:** Financial docs for Stas (TASK-FIN-008) - check if Stas needs today

**Priority Ranking (if time constrained):**
1. 🔴 TASK-FIN-001 (Darya birthday - TODAY IS THE DAY!)
2. 🔴 TASK-FIN-003 (AI compliance - executive mandate, termination risk)
3. 🔴 TASK-FIN-002 (October bonus table - payroll critical)
4. 🔴 TASK-FIN-006, TASK-FIN-007 (Daily tracking - payroll accuracy)
5. 🟡 TASK-FIN-004 (GPT audit - cost savings, can continue Day 29)
6. 🟡 TASK-FIN-005 (Design budget - can defer to Day 29)
7. 🟡 TASK-FIN-008 (Financial docs - verify urgency with Stas)
8. 🟡 TASK-FIN-009 (Daily research - compliance, 30min)

  - Handle edge cases: Overtime, time-off, power outages make-up time
- Replace manual 3x daily checks with automated sync alerts
- Build executive financial dashboard (revenue, expenses, payroll, cash flow)

**Coordination:** Finance (FIN) ↔ AI & Automation (AID)

#### Potential Executive Assignment #3: Company-Wide Tool Subscription Optimization
**Rationale:**
- Kateryna managing subscriptions (GPT, design tools, development tools, video tools)
- GPT audit (TASK-FIN-004) identifying cost savings opportunities
- Company scaling requires systematic tool cost management

**Proposed Task:**
- Conduct company-wide tool subscription audit (beyond just GPT):
  - All SaaS tools, AI services, design subscriptions, development tools
  - Map: Who uses what, how often, what it costs
  - Identify: Unused licenses, duplicate tools, optimization opportunities
- Create tool usage dashboard (executive visibility into all subscriptions)
- Implement approval workflow (new tool requests, renewals, cancellations)
- Negotiate volume discounts (consolidate accounts, annual vs monthly pricing)
- Track ROI: Tool value vs cost, utilization rates

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (comprehensive audit + implementation)
**Expected ROI:** 20-40% reduction in tool costs, better resource allocation, executive visibility
