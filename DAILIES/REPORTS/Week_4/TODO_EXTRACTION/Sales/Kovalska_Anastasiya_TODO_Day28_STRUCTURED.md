## 📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

### Time Budget (Day 28)
| Task | Priority | Time | Running Total |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| TASK-SLS-001: Discovery call follow-up | 🔴 Critical | 0.5h | 0.5h |
| TASK-SLS-004: Prompt v7 Days 24-27 | 🔴 Critical | 1.5h | 2h |
| TASK-SLS-002: Ex-client response tracking | 🔴 Critical | 2h | 4h |
| TASK-SLS-003: Active lead follow-up | 🔴 Critical | 2h | 6h |
| TASK-SLS-005: Metrics tracking setup | 🟡 High | 1h | 7h |
| TASK-SLS-006: Antigravity setup | 🟡 High | 1.5h | 8.5h |
| TASK-SLS-010: Daily AI research | 🟡 High | 0.5h | 9h |
| **Total Planned** | | **9h** | **112% capacity** |

### Deferred to Days 29-30
- TASK-SLS-007: Pipeline visibility review (1h) - can do Day 28 if time, otherwise Day 29
- TASK-SLS-008: Ex-client segmentation (2h) - defer to Day 29
- TASK-SLS-009: Research documentation (2h) - defer to Days 29-30 (original plan)

### Capacity Analysis
**Realistic Assessment:**
- Day 28 slightly over-allocated (9h planned for 8h day)
- Discovery call follow-up may take <30min if efficient (quick win)
- Prompt v7 compliance is MANDATORY (non-negotiable 1.5h)
- Active lead follow-up critical for revenue (cannot defer)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Morning focus**: Discovery call (quick) + Prompt v7 compliance (mandatory) + Ex-client tracking
2. **Afternoon focus**: Active lead follow-up (revenue-critical) + Metrics setup + Antigravity
3. **Defer if needed**: Pipeline review (TASK-SLS-007) can move to Day 29
4. **Daily research**: Complete even if late (15min minimum - watch video, quick notes)

**Priority Ranking (if time constrained):**
1. 🔴 TASK-SLS-004 (Prompt v7 - executive mandate, termination risk if non-compliant)
2. 🔴 TASK-SLS-001 (Discovery call - already 3 days overdue, prospect may lose interest)
3. 🔴 TASK-SLS-002 (Ex-client tracking - revenue pipeline, measure Week 3 campaign)
4. 🔴 TASK-SLS-003 (Active lead follow-up - prevent revenue loss)
5. 🟡 TASK-SLS-006 (Antigravity - AI compliance, productivity gain)
6. 🟡 TASK-SLS-005 (Metrics - process improvement, can start even if not complete)
7. 🟡 TASK-SLS-010 (Daily research - compliance, can be 15min instead of 30min)

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### High-Risk Items

**Risk #1: Prompt v7 Non-Compliance (Termination Risk)**
- **Impact:** Termination per owner directive ("work no longer needed")
- **Probability:** High (Day 27 daily.md missing, not yet compliant with Days 24-25 requirement)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **URGENT**: Create Day 27 daily.md retroactively (document from memory/notes)
  - Allocate full 1.5h for TASK-SLS-004 (no shortcuts)
  - Request Artemchuk (AID-001) support if Prompt v7 issues encountered
  - Document AI usage comprehensively going forward (zero gaps)
- **Owner:** Kovalska Anastasiya (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

**Risk #2: Discovery Call Prospect Lost (Delay Too Long)**
- **Impact:** High-value opportunity lost, prospect chooses competitor
- **Probability:** Medium-High (already 3 days overdue from Monday priority)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Send materials within first hour of Day 28 (9:00-9:30 time block)
  - Apologize for delay, provide compelling value in follow-up
  - Follow up again in 48h if no response
  - Prepare to move on if prospect unresponsive (sunk cost)
- **Owner:** Kovalska Anastasiya (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

**Risk #3: Low Ex-Client Response Rate**
- **Impact:** Week 3 campaign ineffective, revenue pipeline weak
- **Probability:** Medium (ex-client list data quality issues, end-of-year timing)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Track actual response rate (measure reality vs 10% target)
  - If <5% response: Analyze messaging, adjust approach for Tier 2 outreach
  - If >10% response: Scale approach, apply learnings to future campaigns
  - Prepare alternative pipeline sources (inbound, referrals, new prospecting)
- **Owner:** Kovalska Anastasiya

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk #4: Antigravity Learning Curve Reduces Day 28 Productivity**
- **Impact:** Setup takes longer than 1.5h, reduces time for sales activities
- **Probability:** Medium (new tool, first-time setup)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Time-box setup to 1.5h max on Day 28
  - Focus on basic setup + 1 workflow test (research or outreach)
  - Continue advanced testing Days 29-30
  - Request AI team (Artemchuk) support if stuck
- **Owner:** Kovalska Anastasiya

**Risk #5: CRM-Sheets Manual Sync Time Sink**
- **Impact:** Administrative tasks consume sales time
- **Probability:** Medium (known blocker from Week 4 Plan)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document time spent on manual sync (for automation business case)
  - Coordinate with AI team (AID) for future automation
  - Focus CRM updates on critical opportunities only (80/20 rule)
- **Owner:** Kovalska Anastasiya

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE TASK ASSIGNMENTS (Day 28)

### For Executive Review & Decision

#### Executive Visibility: Ex-Client Campaign Effectiveness
**Task:** TASK-SLS-002
**Metric:** Response rate from Week 3 outreach (~50 contacts)
**Purpose:** Measure campaign ROI, determine if ex-client strategy worth scaling
**Data Collection:** Day 28
**Reporting:** End of Day 28 or Day 29 morning

**What to Track:**
- Contacts reached (Week 3): ~50
- Responses received: [Number]
- Response rate: [Percentage]
- Interested (calls scheduled): [Number]
- Not now (nurture): [Number]
- Not interested (close): [Number]

**Insight for Executive:**
- If response rate <5%: Campaign ineffective, need messaging/targeting overhaul
- If response rate 5-10%: Marginal success, optimize and continue
- If response rate >10%: Strong campaign, scale approach and allocate more resources

**Recommendation:**
- Based on data, advise whether to invest in systematic ex-client re-engagement (TASK-SLS-008 tiered approach)
- Calculate ROI: Cost of outreach vs potential revenue from reactivated accounts

**Owner Directive Context:**
- "Those who refuse to write/use AI - work no longer needed"
- "This year, manual work phase ends completely"
- Zero tolerance policy, administrative checks ongoing

**Escalation Path:**
- Quality issues with Prompt v7 → Artemchuk Nikolay (AID-001)
- Non-compliance → Executive team (termination consequences per owner)

**Action Required:**
- Anastasiya must complete TASK-SLS-004 (Prompt v7 Days 24-27) by EOD Day 28
- Fill Day 27 documentation gap retroactively
- Demonstrate AI compliance going forward (daily research, tool usage, comprehensive logging)
