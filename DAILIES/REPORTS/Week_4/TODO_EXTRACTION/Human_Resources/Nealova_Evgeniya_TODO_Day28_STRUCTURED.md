## 📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

### Time Budget (Day 28)
| Task | Priority | Time | Running Total |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| TASK-HRM-001: Interview follow-up | 🔴 Critical | 2h | 2h |
| TASK-HRM-002: Contract follow-up | 🔴 Critical | 1.5h | 3.5h |
| TASK-HRM-003: Applications backlog | 🔴 Critical | 2h | 5.5h |
| TASK-HRM-004: Checklist refinement | 🟡 High | 1h | 6.5h |
| TASK-HRM-008: Prompt v7 compliance | 🔴 Critical | 1h | 7.5h |
| TASK-HRM-009: Whisper Flow logging | 🟡 High | 0.5h | 8h |
| **Total Planned** | | **8h** | **100% capacity** |

### Deferred to Day 29 (If Needed)
- TASK-HRM-005: Recruitment documentation (2h) - can start but may not complete
- TASK-HRM-006: Stas/Katerina follow-ups (1h) - defer if critical tasks overrun
- TASK-HRM-007: Video editor discussion (1h) - schedule meeting but may occur Day 29

### Capacity Analysis
**Realistic Assessment:**
- Day 28 is fully allocated with critical tasks (8h planned)
- Applications backlog may take longer if volume large (risk factor)
- Back-to-back interviews Days 26-27 likely created fatigue
- AI compliance tasks non-negotiable (owner mandate)

**Recommendations:**
1. Focus on critical recruitment tasks (interview/contract/backlog follow-ups)
2. Complete AI compliance (Prompt v7) before EOD (mandatory)
3. Defer documentation tasks if critical tasks exceed estimates
4. Schedule video editor discussion but meeting may occur Day 29

- **Mitigation:**
  - Set 24-48h response deadline for urgency
  - Prepare replacement pipeline (applications backlog)
  - Escalate to management if pattern emerges
- **Owner:** Nealova Evgeniya
