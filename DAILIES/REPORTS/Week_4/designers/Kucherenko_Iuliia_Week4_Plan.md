## 5. Blockers & Required Support

### Current Blockers
1. **Lead Generator Scheduling:** Training postponed in Week 3 due to conflicts
   - **Action:** Coordinate with LG team lead Monday morning to lock in Tuesday slot
   - **Support Needed:** LG team commitment to attend, managementbackup if needed

2. **Client Assignment Uncertainty:** Unclear if test assignment received or deadline
   - **Action:** Clarify with sales/management Monday
   - **Support Needed:** Clear deadline and requirements from client services

3. **PixelCut Credits Exhausted:** May need resizing tool alternative
   - **Action:** Identify alternative (Adobe Firefly worked in Week 3)
   - **Support Needed:** May need tool credit approval

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **AI Model Consistency:** Gemini drifts on mascot details, ChatGPT slower
   - **Mitigation:** Use Sonnet for critical consistency needs, ChatGPT for accuracy
   - **Support Needed:** Team feedback on model experiences

2. **Training Time Investment:** 2-hour session reduces design production time
   - **Mitigation:** Schedule Tuesday when Module 2 complete, buffer day
   - **Support Needed:** Understanding from management on production impact

3. **Mobile Readability Requirements:** Client emphasized critical importance
   - **Mitigation:** Mandatory mobile preview before any delivery, document standards
   - **Support Needed:** Design team adoption of mobile-first checklist

## 6. Skill Development / Improvements

### Based on Week 3 Performance

**Strengths to Leverage:**
- Excellent prompt engineering (10-12 high-quality Module 1 images)
- Strong tool evaluation (Gemini vs ChatGPT analysis)
- Effective documentation (Runway animation instruction)
- Cross-functional training capability (preparing LG training)

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Time Tracking:** 30 hours for 8 team members seems conservative (3.75 hrs/person) - improve accuracy
2. **Mobile-First Practices:** Client feedback highlighted readability issues - need systematic approach
3. **Portfolio Preparation:** Ad-hoc interview prep led to rushed work - establish maintenance routine

### Skill Development Goals for Week 4
1. **AI Model Mastery:**
   - Become expert in optimal model selection for each design task type
   - Document decision criteria that team can easily apply
   - Target: Reduce trial-and-error by 50%

2. **Prompt Engineering Excellence:**
   - Refine character consistency methodology
   - Create reusable prompt templates for common scenarios
   - Share techniques with team through documentation

3. **Training & Mentoring:**
   - Develop training delivery skills through LG session
   - Learn to teach non-designers to create quality graphics
   - Build training materials that enable independent learning

4. **Mobile-First Design:**
   - Establish systematic mobile preview process
   - Learn mobile design best practices from industry resources
   - Create checklist preventing readability issues
