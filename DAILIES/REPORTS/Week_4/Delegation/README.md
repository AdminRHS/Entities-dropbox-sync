## What's New in v2.0

### Department Reclassification
This version correctly identifies task ownership based on **action keywords** rather than source department field:

**Examples:**
- "Retain Vamos employee" → **HR** (not AI)
- "Talk to Dasha about retention" → **HR** (not AI)
- "Communicate final decision to MASEK client" → **Sales** (not AI)
- "Resolve accounting/payment issues" → **Finance** (not AI)
- "Fix email personalization" → **AI/Automation** (correct)

### LIBRARIES Integration
- Integrated `LIBRARIES/Responsibilities` for better role identification
- Matches tasks to responsibility patterns (action + object)
- Provides profession recommendations from responsibility library
