## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why "Project" Status Employees Aren't Logging Work:

**"Project" vs "Work" Status Difference:**
- **"Work" status employees** (13 total) = Full-time Remote Helpers staff who log daily work
- **"Project" status employees** (30 total) = Working on specific client projects, may not be logging in same system

**Hypothesis:**
"Project" employees may be:
1. Working for external clients with separate reporting systems
2. Not required to log daily work in the same format
3. Using different tracking methods (project-specific tools)
4. Part-time/contract workers with different reporting requirements

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Focus on Employees WITH Data (17 employees)
Process the employees who ARE logging work:
- All "Work" status employees (12)
- "Available" status employees actively working (5)
- Already have folder 27 with actual content
- Can apply full MAIN_PROMPT_v7.1 processing

### Option 2: Create Minimal Reports for "Project" Employees
For the 16 "Project" employees with empty logs:
- Document that they have no daily work logged
- Create placeholder Employee_Summary noting "No daily data available"
- Focus processing effort on employees with actual data

### Option 3: Investigate Alternative Data Sources
- Check if "Project" employees log work elsewhere
- Look for project-specific reporting systems
- Check with managers about their reporting requirements

## REVISED PROCESSING PLAN

### PRIORITY 1: Process 17 Employees WITH Folder 27 Data

These employees HAVE actual work logged and CAN be processed:

**Already Processed (Nov 24 only):**
1. Kucherenko Iuliia (Design) - UPDATE with Nov 25-27

**Need Processing (Nov 24-27):**
2. Bogun Polina (Design)
3. Skrypkar Vilhelm (Design)
4. Bykova Anastasiia (Design)
5. Hlushko Mariia (Design)
6. Kizilova Olha (Dev)
7. Danylenko Liliia (Dev)
8. Ponomarova Kateryna (Finance)
9. Yelisieieva Daria (Finance)
10. Nealova Evgeniya (HR)
11. Pasichna Anastasiia (HR)
12. Rekonvald Viktoriya (HR)
13. Burda Anna (LG)
14. Shkinder Kseniia (LG)
15. Davlatmamadova Firuza (LG)
16. Cynthia Aninwezi (LG)
17. Podolskyi Sviatoslav (Video)
18. Azanova Darʼya (Video)
19. Artemchuk Nikolay (AI)
20. Perederii Vladislav (AI)

**Total:** 20 employees (1 update + 19 new)

### PRIORITY 2: Document "No Data" for 16 "Project" Employees
Create simple status notes rather than full processing

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Confirm approach: Process 17-20 employees WITH data OR all 17 original "Project" employees?
2. If processing employees with data: Begin with MAIN_PROMPT_v7.1 workflow
3. If processing "Project" employees: Clarify what to do with empty daily.md files

**Files to Create:**
- Employee_Summary_Week4.md for each employee with data
- daily_processed.md in folder 27 (for Nov 27 specifically)
- TODO.md in folder 28 (next-day planning)
- Updated department reports

---

## SUMMARY

**The Original Task:** Process 17 "Project" status employees
**The Reality:** 16 of 17 have NO work data logged
**The Opportunity:** 20 employees (different from original 17) HAVE rich work data ready for processing

**Recommendation:** Pivot to processing the 20 employees who have actual daily work logged, as they will provide valuable Employee_Summary reports. The 16 "Project" employees with empty logs cannot be processed until they start logging work.
