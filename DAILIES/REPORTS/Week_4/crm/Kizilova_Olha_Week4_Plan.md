## 5. Blockers & Required Support

### Current Critical Blockers
1. **Admin Login 500 Error:** Blocking course management functionality
   - **Action:** Immediate debugging Monday, check token generation/validation
   - **Support Needed:** May need senior dev consultation if complex

2. **Auth Service OAuth Config:** Redirect URI not configured, 500 error
   - **Action:** Contact Auth service team Monday with detailed request
   - **Support Needed:** Auth service team response and configuration

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **Auth Service Response Time:** May not respond quickly
   - **Mitigation:** Send detailed request Monday, follow up Tuesday if no response
   - **Support Needed:** Management escalation if unresponsive

2. **Admin Login Complexity:** Authentication issue may be deeper than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Systematic debugging approach, check auth flow end-to-end
   - **Support Needed:** Senior dev pairing if needed

3. **Responsive Issues Scope:** May uncover many issues requiring fix time
   - **Mitigation:** Document all issues first, prioritize critical ones
   - **Support Needed:** Design team consultation on intended responsive behavior

4. **Browser Compatibility:** Testing on multiple browsers time-consuming
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on Chrome first, then Firefox/Safari
   - **Support Needed:** Testing tools or environment setup
