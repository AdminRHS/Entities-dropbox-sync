## November 28, 2025 - Detailed Activity Data

### Daily Work Log

# Daily Log - [29.11.2025]



### **Session 1: Managing the Lead Calendar** (10am)
**Topic:** Instructions on booking calls via the "Lead Calendar" and syncing them with the internal system.

*   **Time Zone Management:** When accessing the Lead Calendar, the time zones (e.g., Eastern European Time/Kyiv) are automatically converted. You do not need to manually calculate the time difference; simply select an available slot (e.g., 10:30 AM).
*   **Syncing Calendars:** Bookings made on the Lead Calendar **do not** automatically sync to our internal (LG) calendar. After booking a call on the Lead Calendar, you must manually add the entry to the LG calendar.
*   **Data Entry:**
    *   When adding the event to the internal calendar, copy all relevant information (Company info, Lead info) from LinkedIn.
    *   **Exception:** You do not need to input the Sales or Lead email addresses in the internal calendar entry, as those are already captured in the Lead Calendar system.
*   **Communication:** Once the call is booked, notify the Sales Department (specifically Anastasia) so they can review and accept the calendar invitation.

***

### **Session 2: Project Remess & AI Graphic Generation** (12pm)
**Topic:** Introduction to the "Remess" hiring project, brand guidelines (Cat Mascot), and using ChatGPT to generate social media graphics.

**1. Brand Overview**
*   **Project:** Remess (a hiring platform).
*   **Visual Identity:** Specific color palette featuring a **Cat Mascot**. This mascot appears across the website and social media (Instagram/LinkedIn).
*   **Deliverables:** You will be creating social media graphics. Unlike previous posts that promoted specific job vacancies, these posts will focus on broader content, such as "Tools for Remote Employees" or "Work-from-Home Experiences."

**2. Technical Specifications**
*   **Platform:** LinkedIn.
*   **Format:** Square (1080 x 1080 pixels).
*   **Tools:** ChatGPT (specifically using the "Projects" feature).

**3. Setup Instructions**
*   **File Access:** Access the "Remess" folder on Google Drive. Inside, locate the `Social Media` subfolder containing:
    *   `Mascot Prompts` (Reference images of the cat).
    *   `UI Kit & Design Guidelines` (Fonts, colors).
    *   `Post References` (Examples of previous work).
*   **ChatGPT Project Setup:**
    1.  Create a new Project in ChatGPT (e.g., named "Remess Graphics").
    2.  **Crucial:** Enable "Project Memory."
    3.  Upload the **Master Prompt File** and **Mascot Reference Images** to the project knowledge base. This ensures the AI remembers the brand style.

**4. Generating Images**
*   **Prompting:** Use the "Universal Option" prompt found in the instructions. Do not worry about specific placeholders unless the post is about a specific vacancy.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   Feed the post content/text to ChatGPT.
    *   Ask it to generate the graphic title and concept.
    *   Request the image generation using the uploaded design constraints.
*   **Quality Control:** If the generated cat looks different from the mascot (e.g., wrong eyes, wrong style), explicitly remind the AI: *"Please review the uploaded mascot references and regenerate."* You can also ask for specific edits, such as *"Add a world map to the background."*

***

### **Session 3: VS Code & Daily Reporting Support** (with Dama _4pm)
**Topic:** Troubleshooting VS Code, setting up the "Codecs" extension, and automating daily reports.

**Q: Is there a specific template for the daily plans and tasks files?**
**A:** Yes. You can find the template in the `Week 1` > `Folder 05` > `Daily` folder. You can simply copy and paste this structure into your new daily file.

**Q: How do I use AI to fill out these reports automatically?**
**A:** You can use the Claude AI integration within VS Code.
1.  Open the folder containing the previous day's report.
2.  Instruct the AI: *"Please fill out the file for today (Folder 28) using the same structure as the file in Folder 05."*
3.  Ensure you provide the correct file path so the AI can locate the reference file.

**Q: I'm getting an error telling me to "Open in Legacy Account." How do I fix this?**
**A:** This is likely an extension issue.
1.  Go to the **Extensions** tab in VS Code (left sidebar).
2.  Search for **"Codecs"**.
3.  Install the first result.
4.  Once installed, try running the prompt again.

### Plans and Priorities

## Daily Plan - 29.11.2025 # ##


## Instructions ## ##
**What**: Strategic plan for next steps  
**Include**:  
- Check how the Black Friday messages are doing and scale what's working  
- Keep pushing through the new batch of companies from job sites  
- Get some designs done using the ChatGPT template we made  
- Keep everything updated in Dropbox so the admin knows what's happening  
- Work on Job sites


***


## Today's Review ## ##
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Yesterday we sent out 5 versions of Black Friday messages on LinkedIn, so today I need to see which one is getting better responses and keep pushing that one.  
- Got a fresh stack of companies from job sites to work through, need to research them and get them ready for outreach.  
- Set up that ChatGPT workspace for designs yesterday, so today I'm gonna use it to make some posts for our social media accounts.  
- Gotta keep syncing everything to Dropbox so the admin can see what I'm working on and track progress.  
- Plan is to get some quick wins today on the Black Friday campaign and move through as many company qualifications as I can.


***


## Prioritized Action Items ## ##


### High Priority ## ###
1. **Check how the Black Friday messages are performing**
   - Goal: Pull the engagement numbers from yesterday's Black Friday messages on both LinkedIn accounts and see which version is getting more replies and opens.  
   - Expected outcome: I'll know which message is actually working better so I can focus on that one and stop wasting time on the weaker version.  
   - Deadline: Get the data by morning, then start scaling the winner by afternoon.

2. **Work through and qualify the new companies**
   - Goal: Take the batch of companies from job sites and do some quick research on each one. Check out their LinkedIn, website, figure out who the right person to contact is, and add notes about whether they're a good fit.  
   - Expected outcome: Have a solid list of maybe 15-20 companies that are actually worth reaching out to, with all the info I need to personalize my messages.  
   - Deadline: Get at least 10 companies done by end of day.


### Medium Priority ## ###
1. **Design some social media posts with the new template**
   - Goal: Use the ChatGPT workspace we set up to make 3-4 posts for our Remote Helpers social accounts. Mix it up with some company updates, service highlights, that kind of thing.  
   - Expected outcome: Have a few solid posts ready to go that look professional and on-brand, ready to schedule and publish whenever we need them.  
   - Deadline: Get them done and uploaded to Dropbox by end of day.

2. **Tweak the Black Friday messages based on what we learn**
   - Goal: Once I see which Black Friday message is doing better, I'll take what's working and make the losing one better. Maybe change up the hook or make the CTA clearer.  
   - Expected outcome: A stronger version of the Black Friday message that we can use for the rest of the campaign.  
   - Deadline: Have the improved version ready by late afternoon.

3. **Sync everything to Dropbox**
   - Goal: Make sure I'm uploading all my work as I go through the day so the admin can see what's getting done. New companies list, designs, message updates, everything.  
   - Expected outcome: The admin can check Dropbox anytime and see exactly what I've been working on and what's complete.  
   - Deadline: Final upload at end of day.


### Low Priority ## ###
1. **Add more design templates to the workspace**
   - Goal: If I have some spare time, add a couple more template options to the ChatGPT workspace so we have more variety when we're making designs.  
   - Expected outcome: More templates means faster design work in the future and more options to play with.  
   - Deadline: Do it if I get a chance, no big rush.

2. **Look up what other companies are doing with Black Friday outreach**
   - Goal: Spend some time checking out how other companies are running their Black Friday LinkedIn campaigns, see if there's anything we're missing or could be doing better.  
   - Expected outcome: Some ideas we can steal or improve on for future campaigns.  
   - Deadline: Jot down some notes by end of day if time allows.


***


## Goals and Objectives ## ##
- Figure out which Black Friday message actually works and lean hard into it instead of spreading myself thin.  
- Build up a real list of qualified companies we can actually reach out to and get responses from.  
- Get comfortable using the new ChatGPT design system and prove it actually saves us time.  
- Keep the admin in the loop with regular Dropbox updates so there's no confusion about what's getting done.  
- Keep things moving forward on both the Black Friday push and building out our company pipeline.  
- Get some solid momentum going so we can keep this pace up.


***


## Expected Outcomes ## ##
- Clear answer on which Black Friday message is working better, so we're not guessing anymore.  
- A list of 15-20 companies we actually want to reach out to with all the research done and ready to go.  
- A few quality social media posts that look good and are ready to publish.  
- A better version of the Black Friday message that should get more responses.  
- Admin can see everything we've done in Dropbox without having to ask questions.  
- More momentum and better data to work with as we head into the rest of the Black Friday season.  
- Setting ourselves up to keep scaling what's working without wasting time on what isn't.

   - Goal: Make sure everything we're working on stays updated in Dropbox so the admin always knows what's happening and can review our progress anytime.

   - Deadline: Every day, keep it updated.


### Low Priority ## ###
1. **Build out the design template library**
   - Goal: Gradually add more templates and variations to our ChatGPT workspace for different content types like announcements, case studies, and promotions.  
   - Expected outcome: A bigger toolkit that lets us create designs faster and keeps everything looking professional and on-brand.  
   - Deadline: Add to it whenever we have spare time.

2. **Refine the Black Friday messaging approach**
   - Goal: Once we see how the initial Black Friday messages perform, tweak things like tone, structure, or hooks to make them even more effective.  
   - Expected outcome: A messaging framework that's sharper and hits better with prospects, improving our reply rates over time.  
   - Deadline: After we collect enough data from the current tests, probably within the week.
