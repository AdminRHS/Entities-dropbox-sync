## 1. Training Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

**Principle 1: Documentation Over Explanation**
> "It's much less effort to retain an employee than to replace them. Documentation prevents knowledge loss."

**Principle 2: Research-Based Learning**
- Employees create their own knowledge through guided research
- Research outputs populate company LIBRARIES
- Double benefit: Learning + Content creation

**Principle 3: Tool Proficiency Required**
- Every employee must use AI tools daily
- No exemptions for "traditional" workers
- Early Adopters Only policy

### 1.2 Snowball Task Model

**Concept:** Tasks compound in value over time

**Example Flow:**
```
Day 1: Research tool X
Day 2: Document findings
Day 3: Create prompt for tool X
Day 4: Test prompt, iterate
Day 5: Add to TASK_MANAGERS
Day 6: Train colleague on tool X
Day 7: Colleague creates variation
```

**Result:** One research task → multiple organizational assets

  status: "Completed ✅"

Extracted Skill:
  skill_phrase: "Created REST API endpoint using FastAPI"
  proficiency: "Intermediate"
  frequency: 5
  last_demonstrated: "2025-11-19"
```

### 5.2 Proficiency Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Beginner | 1-5 completions |
| Intermediate | 6-15 completions |
