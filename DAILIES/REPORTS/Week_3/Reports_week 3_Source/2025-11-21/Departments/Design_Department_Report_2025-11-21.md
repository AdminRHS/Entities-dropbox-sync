## 9. IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### Process Improvements

#### 1. Training Session Coordination
- **Priority:** High
- **Current Issue:** Lead generator training session scheduled for 15:00 but cancelled (no participants gathered)
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Send calendar invites with reminders
  - Confirm attendance 1 hour before session
  - Create pre-meeting checklist for participants
  - Post reminder in relevant Discord channels morning-of
- **Expected Impact:** Higher attendance rates, less wasted prep time
- **Effort:** 0.5 days (process documentation and communication templates)
- **Owner:** Bogun Polina, team leads

#### 2. AI Tool Selection Framework
- **Priority:** High
- **Current Issue:** Multiple AI tools used iteratively for design (Gemini/Lovable/Claude/chatbot) with varying quality
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Document strengths and weaknesses of each AI tool for specific tasks
  - Create decision tree: when to use Gemini vs Claude vs chatbot vs Lovable
  - Establish quality benchmarks to avoid endless iteration
  - Share learnings across design team
- **Expected Impact:** Faster design decisions, less time spent on trial-and-error
- **Effort:** 1 week (testing, documentation, team training)
- **Owner:** Bogun Polina, Shymkevych Iryna (experienced with multi-tool workflow)

#### 3. Course Cover Template Standardization
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Current Issue:** Course covers require manual background expansion, palette adjustments, frame sizing
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Create course cover templates with pre-set dimensions and backgrounds
  - Document step-by-step workflow for Firefly/AI Studio expansion
  - Establish mascot positioning guidelines
  - Create prompt library for different course themes
- **Expected Impact:** Faster cover creation, consistent quality, less rework
- **Effort:** 1 week (template creation, documentation)
- **Owner:** Bykova Anastasiia, Safonova Eleonora

### Technical Improvements

#### 4. Runway Animation Optimization
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Current Issue:** Runway animations slow and results not ideal (postponed from day 21)
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Research Runway best practices and prompt optimization
  - Test alternative animation tools (CapCut, Canva free version as mentioned)
  - Create animation prompt library with successful examples
  - Establish when animation adds value vs static images
- **Expected Impact:** Faster animations or informed decision to use alternatives
- **Effort:** 1 week (research, testing, documentation)
- **Owner:** Bogun Polina (attempted animations)

#### 5. Discord Recording Workflow
- **Priority:** Low (Resolved)
- **Current Issue:** Whisper Flow doesn't work in Discord (records only self or no one)
- **Proposed Solution:** ✅ Already implemented
  - Use alternative tool (used by videographers) for calls
  - Use Whisper Flow for reports
  - Document this workflow for other team members facing same issue
- **Expected Impact:** Reliable call recording, consistent documentation
- **Effort:** 0.5 days (documentation)
- **Owner:** Bogun Polina (implemented solution)

### Documentation Improvements

#### 6. Client Test Task Workflow Documentation
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Current Issue:** No standardized workflow for client test tasks (research, design, iteration, submission)
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Document end-to-end workflow from day 21 experience
  - Include: requirements gathering, AI tool selection, iteration process, quality checks
  - Create submission checklist
  - Share with design team
- **Expected Impact:** Consistent client work quality, faster onboarding for new designers
- **Effort:** 0.5 days (documentation)
- **Owner:** Shymkevych Iryna, Bogun Polina
