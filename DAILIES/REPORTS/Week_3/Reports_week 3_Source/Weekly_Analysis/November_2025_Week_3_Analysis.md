## Notes & Observations

**General Notes:**
- **This is the FIRST Phase 0 analysis** - activating the research system!
- Video backlog of 11 videos is significant opportunity for knowledge capture
- 16 Available employees provide excellent research capacity
- Starting conservatively with 2 assignments to prove the process

**Blockers or Risks:**
- **Risk:** Employees may not understand research format (first-time researchers)
  - Mitigation: Provide Video_002 as detailed example, offer midpoint review
- **Risk:** Quality may vary on first submissions
  - Mitigation: Accept "good enough" (score 6+), use as learning opportunity
- **Risk:** LIBRARIES integration may take longer than expected
  - Mitigation: Document process thoroughly as we go, refine for next cycle

**Opportunities:**
- **Video backlog** = 11 research tasks ready to assign (clear pipeline)
- **Available employees** = 16 people ready for research (high capacity)
- **Gap analysis complete** = Clear priorities identified (24 gaps mapped)
- **First cycle success** = Proof of concept for weekly cycling system

**Follow-Up Items:**
- Monitor first completions closely (these set quality standards)
- Document LIBRARIES integration process (create LIBRARIES_UPDATE_PROCESS.md in Phase 1 Step 3)
- Create QUALITY_REVIEW_PROCESS.md (Phase 1 Step 3)
- Prepare for second Phase 0 analysis Monday Dec 2 (will have completion data!)
