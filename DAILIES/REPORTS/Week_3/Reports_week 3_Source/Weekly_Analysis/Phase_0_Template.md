## Priority Scoring

**Formula:** Priority Score = (Urgency × 3) + (Impact × 2)

| Gap ID | Description | Urgency (1-10) | Impact (1-10) | Priority Score | Rank |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|------|
| [GAP-ID] | [Short desc] | [#] | [#] | ([U]×3)+([I]×2) = [Score] | 1 |
| [GAP-ID] | [Short desc] | [#] | [#] | ([U]×3)+([I]×2) = [Score] | 2 |
| [GAP-ID] | [Short desc] | [#] | [#] | ([U]×3)+([I]×2) = [Score] | 3 |
| [GAP-ID] | [Short desc] | [#] | [#] | ([U]×3)+([I]×2) = [Score] | 4 |
| [GAP-ID] | [Short desc] | [#] | [#] | ([U]×3)+([I]×2) = [Score] | 5 |
