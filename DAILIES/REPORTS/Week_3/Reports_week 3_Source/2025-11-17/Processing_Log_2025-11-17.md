## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Generate Department Reports:**
   - Use PMT-032 v2.1 workflow manually with AI assistant
   - Process each department using specific prompts (PMT-033 to PMT-043)
   - Output to: `ENTITIES/REPORTS/2025-11-17/Departments/`

2. **Create Master Report:**
   - Aggregate department reports
   - Follow day 20 structure as template
   - Output to: `ENTITIES/REPORTS/2025-11-17/MASTER_REPORT_2025-11-17.md`

### Future Improvements
1. Create validation script to check file completeness before processing
2. Add department inference from employee names/IDs
3. Automate department report generation workflow
