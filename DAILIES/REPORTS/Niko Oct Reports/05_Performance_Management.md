## 1. Early Adopters Only Policy

### 1.1 Innovation Adoption Curve

**Philosophy:** Focus resources on early adopters, not laggards

- Laggards (16%): Won't change

**Strategy:** Invest heavily in first 50%, let bottom 16% self-select out

### 1.2 Implementation

**For Early Adopters:**
- More training resources
- First access to new tools
- Leadership opportunities
- Higher visibility

**For Laggards:**
- Clear expectations
- Documentation requirements
