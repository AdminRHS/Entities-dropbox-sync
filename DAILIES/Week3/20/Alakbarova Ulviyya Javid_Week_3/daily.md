**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Yes, let's continue. He told me that yesterday, this is also an old message. I think that one of the best ways to get a call and to book a call besides working with Jobsite and Google Strap is to message the old connection. Because it's really, really helpful even before working with Jobsite and with Google Strap. You need to write all the leads every day. It's really important to make it need to be consistent. You need to be consistent with messages because messages is the best way to book a call besides adding new leads. So, as you can see, this is the old lead, and the first message they sent him was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, and 4 years ago, and then we got a new message that we have guys. I use this message because I think this message is great as well. It's really similar to this one that I used myself, my own version of this message, but for now, I use this message because I think this is a really great message. You have all the useful information right here: for long-term (3-5 days), 2-3 trial days, all the available positions, and, of course, the 50-minute scope. Everything that I mentioned before. That I used like a couple months ago, so this is the new type of this message. I send this message. Remember, I told you the key message that every time works. So, I sent this message. As you can see, the lead answered; he offered that he needs partnership, and sometimes you need to make sure that a lot of leads they misconception they misunderstood the information, and they might think that like they need to work themselves, but, as you know, we offer special like we work different, so you need to clearly understand what is the point. If they talk about partnership, this is usually means that they are interested in hiring people. In a lot of cases. So, that's why in that case I use ChatGPT because you see he himself has some kind of work website that they use, and for this one they need like freelancers and clients and workers. So, in that case, I usually don't use ChatGPT for answering to leads, but it sounds a bit more like I would say not complicated but kinda difficult. So, that's why I wrote to him through ChatGPT. Like the first part you can see, and in ChatGPT, I usually add something for myself, so I add like this time (15 minutes call) and what he thinks. As you can see, guys, he sent his calendar. So, I immediately through his calendar, and we said everything went great, but the call didn't happen because, as you can see, that lead wrote himself that he has some issue, he has some meeting, but here is scheduled to 4 p.m. So, I think the call is happening maybe right now, and also right here I have another lead. But, this lead is kind of also this is the type of lead that shows he's interested, but he disappeared. So, I'm not going to write him any more messages. I wrote him yesterday to remind him, but I'm not going to write him anymore because maybe he's going to come back later. But, this lead shows he's interested; he even sent an email. We even booked a call, but he didn't accept the call. So, for now, I'm going to just leave him right here, but I'm going to remind him later. This was very similar to meet to this one, but finally, we found a way and we booked a call, and this call happened. But, we have a really huge conversation with this lead. She was needed really like help a couple of times, but for some reason, we couldn't do the call, and then I wrote to her once again just to remind her that we still exist and we still offer specialists. We still have 2-3 trial days, and she said that she needs help with this type of work. After some time in some discussion, we booked a call, and this call happened. So, yes, and just for like last example, I'm just going to show this lead as well, and that's going to be enough. I think. This is the message that I told you before, the two messages that I came by together that I put in it.
Refused to accept the call. You don't need to. How to say to leave them? You can just write to them like so: Know the reason if they don't answer you, or if they don't tell you the reason, you can ask for it. You can just suggest them a different time because maybe they are busy or have other work. So, you can dare. Nothing wrong with just reminding them. Just write a short message. This message doesn't need to be very heavy or too boring with too much information. It could be just a short reminder that our call didn't happen. For example: "What do you think about booking our call next week? What is the best time for you?" That's going to be okay as well. In any case, they might answer you. If they don't answer, it means that you can just leave them. As I told before, you can remind them after one month or maybe after two or three months. Something might change. All this message that I show you are with Google Maps leads and an old message. I usually don't have a cold book by job site yet. So, I'm not sure what the reason is, but for now, unfortunately, it's kind of sad that from the job site leads, they usually do not answer. Even if they answer, they are usually not interested. For now, I use our new message template, guys, that we all have. This is the message that I also use myself sometimes. So, I'm going to just copy the link and send it to our chat right here. Everyone can open it, access it, and use it by yourself. Or you can also add maybe information by yourself. For now, that's it. I hope that the information was useful to you guys.
