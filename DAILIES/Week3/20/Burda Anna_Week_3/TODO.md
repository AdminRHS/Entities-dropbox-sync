## 🔹 1. Summary of Today's Activity
Yeah. You should do so. I can help with it. Thank you, Donna. Okay. Hello Isaac, can you see the left side of your screen? I mean in the VS Code? Yeah. A little bit more left? Like, can you say for what email, like what account do you have in your Visual Code? It's your personal or... Okay, okay. Again, the left side, in the bottom, you can see the setting button in the paradigm. Yeah, and the account button is above the setting button on the left side, Isaac. Okay, this, right? Yes, yes. Okay, oh, you don't have an account at all, I think. Uh, okay. At the very bottom of your screen, you can see the search line, not in the Visual Code. Yeah, right panel here, please. Like, yes, choose the first one, device, the first one on the left side. Yes, should I close? Yeah, try to close so we can see your long screen. Okay, but give me a second. Yes, now choose programs and features. Find Dropbox and maybe scroll a little bit down. Do you have Dropbox installed on your laptop? Yes, it's here. This is it. Okay, let's move back. If you can't find it, choose default programs. Try to find Dropbox here. There, yes. So you have to uninstall it. Uninstall? Try to click right side. Right, right, right, right click. Yes, so right click is not working here? Except, um, scroll to the very down. Okay, scroll a little bit up. Зрозуміло. Yes, more? Okay. В нього якихось триста версій цього дропбоксу. Не бачу. Я не знаю, як удалять. Цікаво... Серед. І нехай він відкриється в панелі, а просто серчить дроп бокс і там буде один. Він там має бути типу найперший на панелі. I have tried the first one. Does it stack? No, press Cancel. We have to know which one exactly are you downloading. Yes, because one website can give you the same so you will not be able to log in to the right account. Can you please close the apps, the tabs that you don't need now? Maybe that will help with processing. OK, and now try again. OK, it's always blank. Okay, try to open the another one, like Chrome user, not LG. The normal Chrome? Like my work profile? Is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, just another one. And try Chrome Box Desktop. And try to open the first link again. You know what I mean? Not this one, but the search page. Yes, yes, this one. Try to open this again. It's the same, I think. Okay, let's try to install this one. Maybe that will work. No, no, no. Just save it somewhere. Open the app. You have it in your instant. And now they will give you a link you should open in Google Chrome, but you have to open it in LG Chrome. This way, you will achieve access to build the account. So, why it is processing... Close this tab and close this window. At all. I should close it up. Just hide it. You don't have to close it. Yes, hmm... Open signing now. Close it again. Open the tab with LG account, and then press to open. That is what I was talking about. You have to open this. Now, press on Dropbox and open signing. Okay, continue with a continuous return. Yes, open Dropbox. Next, yes. My name. Really choose another location. That's something strange, I think. Yes, just okay. Can you close it?
