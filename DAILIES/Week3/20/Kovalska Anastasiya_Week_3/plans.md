## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**

Today was a productive day focused on training setup, design interviews, and process improvements:

1. **SMM Training Setup**: Created L2 Media channels, planned training for lead generators and designers starting this week
2. **Design Interviews**: Multiple interviews conducted and prepared, portfolios reviewed, candidates selected
3. **Email Design Discussion**: Clarified Zoho HTML email requirements, need templates and design standards
4. **Course Expansion**: Discussed making SMM course available beyond 3 lead generators to all interested team members
5. **Onboarding Process**: Established proper Remote Helpers onboarding with HR team, centralized documentation
6. **Holiday Schedule**: Multiple clients asking about Christmas/New Year holidays, need clarification from Коля
7. **Team Updates**: Нама Сіка situation resolved, Марта situation needs attention (potential project end December 1st)
8. **Tool Implementation**: Antigravity downloaded, Claude extension added - research done, starting to use for better planning and file analysis

Key Issues:
- SMM specialist shortage - training lead generators as solution
- Email design templates needed for Zoho HTML emails
- Holiday schedule needs final confirmation
- Марта needs graphic design project (currently only UX available)
- Course needs to be improved and made more accessible
