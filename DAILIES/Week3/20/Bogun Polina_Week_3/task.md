## Task 1: Lead-generator training prep & facilitation

### Steps:
1. Align with Nastya/Vilgeim on meeting time, attendee list, and agenda
2. Summarize instruction document into a concise walkthrough + checklist
3. Prepare demo assets (UI kit, references, example prompts/results)
4. During session, guide lead generators through the steps and observe their generation attempts
5. Capture questions/issues and update instructions or materials as needed

### Resources and Links:
- Instruction doc + reference folder (UI kit, guidelines, mascots)
- Remote Employees site & Figma file
- Meeting notes template / shared doc

### Instructions:

Focus on clarity: explain inputs (copy, prompt, mascot) and expected outputs. Have backup examples ready in case generators get stuck. Document everything so the process can scale without designers present.

## Task 2: Finalize course module visuals & animation delivery

### Steps:
1. QA all generated images/animation frames (composition, sizing, brand consistency)
2. Export final assets in required formats and naming conventions

4. Log delivery status and await approval/feedback

### Resources and Links:

## Task 3: Document Gemini + ChatGPT workflow

### Steps:
1. Outline the division of labor: Gemini for prompt writing, ChatGPT for generation
2. List prompt structures that work best (mascot gender enforcement, logo placement, size notes)
3. Note tool quirks (ChatGPT speed, Gemini reliability, when to switch)
4. Store doc in shared knowledge base and link relevant assets

### Resources and Links:
- Personal prompt notes
- Knowledge base/Notion
- Tool accounts (Gemini, ChatGPT)

### Instructions:

Keep the write-up short but actionable. Include screenshots or sample prompts/results if helpful. Update it after the training session if new insights emerge.
