## Activities

### [9:00 - 13:00] - [Course cover delivery & interview prep]
**What I worked on:**
- Finished all Game Academy course covers (correct dimensions, renamed files)
- Confirmed with team lead that covers met requirements and received approval to upload/replace assets and update the Google sheet
- Uploaded covers, updated prompts/links in the sheet, and replaced assets on the Academy site
- Met with team leads (Yulia, Vilgeim) to prepare for client interview: reviewed portfolio, identified relevant work, discussed interview flow
- Added missing projects (site redesign, email campaign, presentation) to Google Drive portfolio and pre-opened files for quick access
- Clarified afternoon plan with Vilgeim after interview

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I finished all the covers for the courses. I made them all the correct sizes and renamed them. I asked the team lead whether the covers meet the requirements and if I can upload them, replace them on the Academy, and also add the prompts and links to the Google sheet. He said yes! I uploaded everything, entered all data into the sheet, and replaced the covers on the Academy site. Then all the team leads—Yulia and Vilgeim—joined us and told us that in an hour we would have an interview. They asked if we had work that could suit this client. Each of us showed our work; we discussed what the client needs, how the interview would go, etc. They told us to add a few more pieces if anything was missing; I had two or three pieces I hadn’t added. After that, I uploaded everything to my portfolio on Google Drive: the website redesign, the email campaign, and the presentation I made for the client. They also told us to prepare everything and open the files so that they don’t take long to load during the interview, which I did. I also asked Vilgeim what I should do after lunch, after the interview, once I got back in the afternoon.]


**Outcomes:**
- Game Academy covers delivered, uploaded, and documented
- Portfolio ready for client interview

### [13:00 - 14:00] - [Client interview]
**What I worked on:**
- Participated in client interview, presented skills and portfolio work
- Received new assignment from Vilgeim post-interview, reviewed brief, then took lunch before continuing

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[We had an interview where we talked with the client. I shared my skills, showed my work, and after the interview I received an assignment from Vilgeim. I read it, went to lunch, and after lunch continued working on it.]


**Outcomes:**
- Client interview completed; new task assigned for afternoon work

### [15:00 - 18:00] - [Lead-gen post instruction prep & new course assets]
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed task from Vilgeim: designers need to teach lead generators how to create Remote Employees posts using a provided instruction set
- Studied the instruction document alongside the reference folder (UI kit, guidelines, mascot references, existing posts in site/Figma)
- Planned how to explain the workflow and test generation with lead generators; clarified timing (session postponed)
- Interim assignment: created course module images at correct sizes plus an animation
- Crafted prompts in Gemini (better descriptive text) and generated images in ChatGPT (preferred output) despite slower performance

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I received a task from Vilgeim saying designers need to teach lead generators to make posts for Remote Employees. Nastya, the Sales Manager, will gather the lead generators, and I need to explain the instructions sent to me. They sent me the instructions that the lead generators will use. I have to read them and then sit with the lead generators and test how generation works for them, because they must be able to generate without designers. I also received a folder with materials: post references, UI kit, design guideline, and mascot references, plus a site and Figma file with previous posts. I need to see how the lead generators work with this instruction and then try creating images for posts myself. If they can’t do it, or leadership wants changes, I’ll need to update the instruction or adjust the materials. So I studied the instruction, all materials, and prepared an explanation. I asked when exactly the session would happen—they said they hoped to gather today but weren’t sure. Later they told me that today no one would gather; instead they were given another task—to make images for a course, at correct sizes, and create an animation for a module. That’s what I did. I wrote prompts in Gemini because I like the descriptive prompts it writes, then generated in ChatGPT because I prefer its image results (even if slower). Gemini still writes great prompts.]


**Outcomes:**
- Prepared onboarding plan for lead generators (instructions/materials reviewed, explanation outline ready)
- Created course module images + animation assets using Gemini prompts + ChatGPT generation
- Await scheduling info for the lead generator training session

## Notes
- Game Academy covers delivered; portfolio updated for client call
- Need to coordinate lead-generator training session (instructions ready, awaiting schedule)
- Gemini for prompts + ChatGPT for generation remains preferred combo for new course assets

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
