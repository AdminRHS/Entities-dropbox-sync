**Include**:
- Review your daily.md
- Prioritized action items
- Goals and objectives
- Expected outcomes

## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**

- **Antigravity Installation & Setup**: Installed and configured Antigravity (Google's IDE) with designers in the morning. Antigravity is similar to VS Code/Cursor, currently free in open beta, includes Gemini 3 Pro model. Can be used with Claude extension (Claude extension available). Login uses same account as Cursor (department account, not personal).

- **Automation Work Completed**: Organized all automations and report outputs to Google Sheets. Integrated Discord merch reports with CRM reports. Created detailed plan for automation project using AI chat, then passed plan to Antigravity which generated all necessary project files.

- **Google Cloud Project Setup**: Created new project "attendants" in Google Cloud Console on admin account. Created new service account, obtained new key, shared Google Sheet with service account for data access. Currently waiting for AI to connect everything, then will deploy.

- **Account Management Notes**: Cursor Pro paid everywhere except DD. Tokens on admin Cursor account will expire November 27. All accounts are operational (department accounts, not personal). Need to update catalog data from spreadsheet (opens via admin account).

- **Designer Communication**: Need to inform designers about Antigravity installation. Some designers have interview at 13:00 today for graphic designer position. Will coordinate installation with designers after interview.

- **File Management**: Missing file issue - some team members don't have certain file. Need to copy from someone who has it (Ctrl+T to distribute). File needed for video editors (Sviat, Darya don't have it).

**Key Activities:**
- Antigravity installation and configuration with designers
- Automation system organization and Google Sheets integration
- Google Cloud project creation and service account setup
- Report integration (Discord + CRM)
- Project file generation using Antigravity
