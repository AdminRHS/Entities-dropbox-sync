## Overview

This folder contains all work, plans, tasks, and notes for **Week 3 – Day 20** of the HR Nov25 track for **Rekonvald Viktoriya**.  
Use this directory as a self-contained unit: everything needed to understand what happened on this day should be documented here.

## Structure

- **`PLANNING.md`**: High-level plan, goals, work breakdown, constraints, and end-of-day reflection for Day 20.
- **`TASK.md`**: Detailed task list with status, dates, and notes for each activity.
- **`NOTES.md`**: Free-form notes, ideas, meeting notes, and scratch space while working.
- **`FILES.md`**: Overview of all important files in this folder and what they are used for.
- **`TODO.md`**: Daily TODO list with priorities and action items for Day 20.

## How to Use This Folder

- **Before starting work**: Review `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` to understand what should be done today and in what order.
- **While working**: Keep `TASK.md` updated (statuses, dates, notes) and add quick thoughts or information to `NOTES.md`.
- **After finishing**: Update `PLANNING.md` (End-of-Day Reflection) and ensure `FILES.md` still accurately describes the contents.

Keeping these documents up to date will make it much easier to come back later and quickly understand the context and progress of Day 20.
