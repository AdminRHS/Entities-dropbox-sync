- Collecting and processing data from multiple sources (Discord, CRM, attendance, daily reports)
- Running analysis pipelines to extract employee activity patterns
- Generating personalized task lists based on activity analysis
- Delivering tasks via at least 2 channels (Discord + Email)

## 🔹 2. Priorities for Today

### 🟥 MUST-HAVE (critical)
- Gather all employee data files for November 18th (Discord logs, CRM exports, attendance records, daily reports)
- Fix Discord ID matching issues using profile data from Dropbox
- Run Action Normalization pipeline on daily reports to extract actions
- Generate consolidated employee activity report combining all data sources
- Create personalized TODO.md files for each employee based on their activity
- Set up Discord delivery channel (server NITN8 or direct messages)
- Set up email delivery channel (extract tokens from Dropbox)
- Test delivery channels to ensure employees receive their tasks

### 🟨 NICE-TO-HAVE (optional)
- Improve Action Normalization pipeline accuracy
- Standardize employee folder structures across departments
- Create reusable template system for TODO generation
- Automate the entire pipeline for future use
- Review and refine all generated tasks manually
