I worked on developing a course cover for "HTML Basics for Beginners: Creating Your First Webpage with Gemini". To do this, I first generated a square image with a mascot. After that, I opened the working Figma file and manually configured the image so that there was a solid color background on the left, and the mascot image was positioned on the right side.

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**Meeting Purpose**: Team preparation meeting for client interview at 13:00. The client is seeking a graphic designer with strong English language skills to work on multiple design deliverables.

**Client Requirements Discussed**:

- Banner designs for various purposes
- Newsletter templates
- AI-generated content writing for LinkedIn posts

The team reviewed each designer's portfolio to ensure we have appropriate work samples to show. For my portfolio, we discussed:
- Slideshow created in Photoshop
- Carousel designs (noted for improvement)
- Illustrator illustrations with mockups
- Amazon presentation materials
- Website redesign projects
- University projects including banners

**Key Feedback Received**:
- All text must be readable on mobile devices - this is critical
- For Black Friday designs: emphasize "3 Free Working Days" as the main message
- Use AI tools (ChatGPT) to generate multiple design variations rather than manual creation
- Upload all portfolio work to shared Google Drive folder for client access
- Portfolio pieces can be shown even if created in Ukrainian language
- Consider Black Friday designs with black color elements for thematic association
- LinkedIn posts should use square format for consistency with Instagram

**Design Tips Discussed**:
- When using ChatGPT for banner generation: provide mascot reference, describe the image requirements, add reference images for text styling
- Generate multiple variations (10+ options) using AI before manual refinement
- Ensure proper file quality when uploading to Google Drive
- Add Black Friday thematic elements (gifts, sale tags, etc.)
- Balance between brand colors and Black Friday traditional black

**Team Discussion Points**:
- Task distribution: if video work is needed, it may be delegated to video editors while designers focus on graphic work
- Importance of understanding exact client needs before finalizing approach
- Previous experience: client initially requested graphic designer but actually needed website development
- Preparation of animation examples using Runway (10-minute process)

**Outcomes:**
