Meeting Summary – Key Points
1. Message Limits

Standard rule: 2 messages (first + second).

A third follow-up is acceptable, but never more than 3.

Recommended timing:

Message 1

Message 2 → after 2 days if no reply

Message 3 → after 5–7 days if still no reply

If still no response after the third message → stop messaging.

Do not message leads daily — LinkedIn may flag you for spam.

2. Lead Calendars & Scheduling Calls

When a lead sends their calendar link:

Time zones are usually already adjusted — no need to convert.

You can book the call directly on their calendar.

Calls booked through a lead’s calendar will NOT appear in LG calendar, so:

Notify Anastasia/sales team after booking.

After scheduling: always send a reminder 30–60 minutes before the call.

3. Follow-Ups and Interest Signs

If a lead shows interest (answers messages, sends email, sends calendar, discusses details):

You can continue communication — but keep messages short and clear.

If a lead disappears after showing interest:

You can follow up again after several days or weeks, but do not spam.

4. Message Templates

Several templates are used:

A short introductory message.

A combined message containing:

Specialist roles available

Trial days information

Call suggestion

The “effective follow-up message” is used after the first or second message and often gets replies.

Keep messages concise; long messages look AI-generated and get fewer responses.

5. Old Leads / Re-engagement

You can contact old connections from past years.

If no interest after 3 messages:

Set aside and remind them again after 10 days, 2 weeks, or even next year.

If a lead says they will need specialists later (e.g., early next year), mark and save them to follow up at the correct time.

-Successfully added companies from google
