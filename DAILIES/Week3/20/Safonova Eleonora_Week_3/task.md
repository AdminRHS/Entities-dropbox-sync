- [Google Drive Assets Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h-QXNT-7zK1lZBiBmiO00o-1AgJMg8qL)
- Image editing tools (if format conversion needed)

### Instructions:

**Identify Format Requirements:**

**Common Course Platform Formats:**
```
Mobile/Vertical Formats:
- Instagram Story (1080x1920)
- Mobile carousel (1080x1350)
- Vertical thumbnail (720x1280)

Desktop/Horizontal Formats:
- Desktop header (1920x1080)
- Wide banner (2560x1080)
- Landscape thumbnail (1280x720)

Square Formats:
- Social media square (1080x1080)
- Course thumbnail (600x600)
- Icon/avatar (512x512)

Determine which formats your course platform requires.
```

**Format Adaptation Strategies:**

**Vertical Carousel (1080x1920):**
```
Composition approach:
- Character positioned in upper 2/3
- Key lesson elements visible in frame
- Text space reserved at bottom if needed
- Environment provides context above/below character

Prompt additions:
"portrait orientation, 9:16 aspect ratio, character centered
vertically with environment extending top and bottom"
```

**Vertical Cover (1080x1350):**
```
Composition approach:
- More balanced vertical composition
- Character and environment equally weighted
- Tighter framing than carousel format
- Works well for thumbnails

Prompt additions:
"portrait orientation, 4:5 aspect ratio, balanced composition,
character and scene well-framed within vertical format"
```

**Horizontal Cover (1920x1080):**
```
Composition approach:
- Character positioned left or right
- Environment spreads across frame
- Wider scene context visible
- Good for header images

Prompt additions:
"landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, character positioned
[left/right], scene extends across horizontal frame"
```

**Format Generation Workflow:**

**Option 1: Generate Each Format Separately**
```
Advantages:
- Optimal composition for each format
- Better quality control
- Format-specific adjustments possible

Process:
1. Write format-specific prompt variant
2. Generate image for specific aspect ratio
3. Review and refine
4. Repeat for each format needed
```

**Option 2: Generate Master, Then Crop/Adapt**
```
Advantages:
- Faster for multiple formats
- Consistent base image
- Less regeneration needed

Process:
1. Generate large, high-resolution master image
2. Crop or adapt to each required format
3. Adjust composition as needed for each crop
4. May require regeneration if crops don't work

Note: This approach may compromise quality - prefer Option 1
for professional course materials.
```

**Quality Check Per Format:**

```
For each format variation:
□ Aspect ratio correct for platform
□ Resolution meets quality standards
□ Character clearly visible and recognizable
□ Composition works well in format
□ No important elements cut off
□ Text space available if needed
□ Image quality maintained (no pixelation)
□ File size appropriate for platform

Test on actual platform if possible to verify appearance.
```
