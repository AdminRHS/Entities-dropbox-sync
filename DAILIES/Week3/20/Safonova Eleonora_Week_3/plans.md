## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Successfully generated 10-12 high-quality course illustrations across Module 1
- Completed comprehensive visual assets: vertical carousels, vertical and horizontal cover variants for each lesson
- Established multi-stage image refinement workflow: generation → correction → mascot clothing updates → composition/lighting rework → detail replacement → re-generation
- Developed and refined prompt engineering methodology maintaining character style consistency
- Leveraged multiple AI tools effectively: Gemini for generation and corrections, ChatGPT-5 for character descriptions and stylistic adaptation
- Implemented systematic asset organization in Google Drive with clear folder structure by modules and lessons
- Documented process with notes, edits, and ideas throughout workflow
- Initiated Module 2 visual development with established standards

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Complete Module 2 Visual Development**
   - Goal: Generate all required illustrations for Module 2 lessons
   - Expected outcome: Complete set of vertical carousels and cover variants for Module 2
   - Approach: Apply established workflow and prompt engineering methodology

2. **Refine and Optimize Module 2 Prompts**
   - Goal: Write and refine prompts for all Module 2 scenes
   - Expected outcome: Consistent character style and visual quality across all Module 2 assets
   - Approach: Use ChatGPT-5 for description refinement and Gemini for generation

3. **Maintain Visual Consistency Across Modules**
   - Goal: Ensure Module 2 visuals align with Module 1 style and quality standards
   - Expected outcome: Seamless visual continuity throughout the course
   - Approach: Reference Module 1 assets and apply established character style guidelines

### Medium Priority
1. **Expand Asset Variations**
   - Goal: Create additional format variations if needed for course platform requirements
   - Expected outcome: All necessary aspect ratios and formats available for each lesson
   - Approach: Use established generation workflow with format-specific adjustments

2. **Document Prompt Templates and Guidelines**
   - Goal: Create reusable prompt templates for future modules
   - Expected outcome: Standardized prompt structure for consistent results and faster generation
   - Approach: Compile successful prompts from Modules 1-2 into template library

3. **Optimize Google Drive Organization**
   - Goal: Ensure all assets are properly tagged, named, and organized
   - Expected outcome: Easy asset retrieval and clear version control
   - Approach: Implement consistent naming conventions and folder structure

### Low Priority
1. **Explore Additional AI Tools**
   - Goal: Test alternative AI generation tools for potential workflow improvements
   - Expected outcome: Identify any tools that could enhance quality or efficiency
   - Approach: Trial runs with small test batches

2. **Create Backup and Version System**
   - Goal: Establish systematic backup protocol for all generated assets
   - Expected outcome: Protected assets with clear version history
   - Approach: Implement Google Drive versioning and duplicate backup locations
