## Activities

### [07:55-17:04] - [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h-QXNT-7zK1lZBiBmiO00o-1AgJMg8qL]
**What I worked on:**
- Created a comprehensive set of visual materials for the course (approximately 10-12 images generated)
- Prepared illustrations for each lesson in Module 1: vertical carousels, vertical and horizontal cover variants
- Worked extensively on prompt engineering: formulating, refining, rewriting, and structuring prompts
- Used multiple AI tools: Gemini for image generation and corrections, ChatGPT-5 for character description refinement and stylistic adaptation
- Systematically organized and saved all finished illustrations in Google Drive folders by modules and lessons
- Made separate notes, documented edits and ideas throughout the process
- Started work on Module 2: writing prompts for new scenes, developing visual storylines, creating images

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

"Today I created a comprehensive set of visual materials for the course: in total, about 10-12 images have been generated.
For the first module, I prepared illustrations for each lesson — vertical carousels, as well as vertical and horizontal cover variants.
Each image went through several stages: generation, correction, updating the mascot's clothing, reworking composition and lighting, replacing details, and re-generation when necessary.
In the process, I actively worked on prompts: formulating, clarifying, rewriting, and structuring them to achieve the desired quality and fully preserve the character's style.
I used different tools:
— Gemini for image generation and for some corrections,
— ChatGPT-5 — for improving character descriptions, rewriting prompts, and precise stylistic adaptation.
All finished illustrations I systematically saved and organized in folders on Google Drive to maintain order and a transparent structure by modules and lessons.
Along the way, I made separate notes, documented edits and ideas.
Now I've moved on to the second module: writing prompts for new scenes, thinking through the visual storyline, creating images, and adapting stylistic elements to the overall course design.
I will continue to generate, improve, and organize materials."

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully generated 10-12 high-quality images for Module 1
- Completed full set of lesson illustrations (vertical carousels + vertical/horizontal covers)
- Established efficient multi-stage image refinement workflow
- Developed refined prompt engineering methodology for maintaining character consistency
- Created organized folder structure in Google Drive for systematic asset management
- Began Module 2 visual development with established workflow and standards
