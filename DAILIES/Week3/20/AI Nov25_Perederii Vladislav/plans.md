#### **Detailed Daily Plan**

**Morning Session: Strategic Presentation and Handover of the Finished Tool (9:00 - 12:30)**

**Context:** The morning is dedicated to the most important tasks that require interaction with the team and management. This is the time to demonstrate the value of the work done.

* **9:00 - 10:30: Presentation of the Google Maps project to management.**
* **What will be done (step by step):**
1. **Final Preparation (9:00 - 9:30):** Prepare a short but comprehensive presentation. Opening the final table with 400+ processed companies is the main and most convincing argument.
2. **Presentation Delivery (9:30 - 10:30):** Conduct a demonstration based on the following structure: 1. The problem being solved. 2. How our solution works (briefly about the architecture). 3. **Here are the actual results** (show the table, explain the value of the 'Problem_Score', 'AI_Summary', etc. columns). 4. Potential and next steps.
* **Expected outcome:** Management fully understands the value and potential of the new tool. Feedback has been received, and further goals for this project have been defined.

* **10:30 - 12:30: Implementation and configuration of the HR extension.**
* **Context:** The tool is ready. Now it needs to be deployed to users' computers.
* **What will be done:**
1. **Technical migration and configuration:** Call the HR team. Help them (via screen sharing) create their own API keys for Dropbox and Google. 2. Transfer and adapt the extension/bookmarklet code, pasting their personal credentials into it.
3. **Training and Testing:** Conduct a short training session, demonstrating how to select a file in Google Drive and click the bookmarklet button. Conduct a joint test to ensure the file has successfully appeared in their Dropbox.
* **Expected Result:** The tool is fully configured and operational on the HR department's accounts. The team is trained and can use it independently. The task is fully completed.

**Afternoon Session: Data Production and New Technology Research (1:30 PM - 6:00 PM)**

**Context:** After the morning's strategic tasks, the focus shifts to continuing current work and R&D.

* **1:30 PM - 5:30 PM: Continue processing data from job sites.**
* **What will be done:**
1. **Infrastructure check:** Ensure that the new Google Cloud account is stable and API quotas are active.
2. **Start processing:** Run the main cleansing and enrichment script on the remaining job dataset.
3. **Background monitoring:** While the script is running, periodically monitor its progress and logs.
* **5:30 PM - 6:00 PM (or during breaks): R&D - Testing "Antigravity".**
* **What will be done:**
1. **Installation and initial configuration:** Install and configure the new tool.
2. **Testing on a real task:** Try using it to solve a small, specific problem (for example, writing a small function or refactoring part of an existing code).
3. **Formation of initial impressions:** Evaluate the usability, speed, and intelligence of the tool compared to Cursor.
* **Expected result:** Another significant data set was processed. An initial assessment of the potential of "Antigravity" was formed and a decision was made regarding its further use.
