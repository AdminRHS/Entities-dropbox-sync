#### **Detailed Daily Report**

**What was accomplished yesterday: Full infrastructure restoration and cross-team project completion**

Yesterday was a success story of a crisis recovery and a demonstration of high productivity. Key results were achieved across all areas:
1. **Infrastructure fully restored:** A new Google Cloud account was successfully created, completely removing the main blocker and allowing all cloud development and data processing to resume.
2. **Critical systems repaired:** All systems affected by the disabling of old credentials were repaired and reconfigured, including **automation in n8n** and data migration scripts.
3. **HR project fully completed:** Work on the file migration extension was **brought to a final, functional version**, ready for delivery to end users. 4. Data processing resumed: Thanks to the restored infrastructure, ~1,000 more companies were processed from the job site dataset.

What's planned for today: Presentation, Implementation, and R&D Day**

Today is the logical culmination of several weeks of work. The plan is to demonstrate the value of the tools created, put them into production, and explore new technologies to improve future efficiency.
1. Presentation of the flagship project "Google Maps": The main strategic objective is to present to management a fully developed, tested data collection and analysis model that has already yielded initial results. The goal is to obtain feedback and determine the future of the project.
2. Implementation of the HR tool: The key tactical objective is to deliver the finished solution to end users. This includes not only the technical migration but also training so the team can independently use the new tool. 3. **Continued "Production":** Routine but important work on processing data from job sites will continue in parallel.
4. **Research (R&D):** Time will be allocated for **testing "Antigravity"**—a new, potentially revolutionary tool that could significantly accelerate future development.

**Challenges and Blockers:**
* **The main challenge is the successful transfer and implementation of the tool for HR.** Technical transfer to other accounts always carries the risk of encountering unexpected access rights or configuration issues. Patience and a methodical approach will be required.
* **Minor Risk:** The presentation may trigger a flurry of new ideas and demands from management, which may require an immediate reprioritization of future tasks.
