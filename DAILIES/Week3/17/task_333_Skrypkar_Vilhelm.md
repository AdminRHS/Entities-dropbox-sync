Use this to assess where Eleonora is in the process:

**Phase 1: Foundation (0-25%)**
□ Task opened and acknowledged
□ Tutorial video watched completely
□ Course outline drafted (lesson structure)
□ Learning objectives defined
□ Prerequisites identified

**Phase 2: Content Creation (25-50%)**
□ Lesson structure finalized
□ First 2-3 lessons written
□ Code examples drafted
□ Practice exercises designed
□ Screenshots/visuals prepared

**Phase 3: Development (50-75%)**
□ All lessons written (first draft)
□ All code examples working
□ All exercises have solutions
□ Content reviewed for accuracy
□ Peer feedback incorporated

**Phase 4: Polish (75-100%)**
□ Content edited and refined
□ Formatting consistent
□ Final technical review complete
□ Ready for publication review
□ Uploaded to Academy platform

### Feedback Framework:

**1. Course Structure Assessment**

✅ **Good Structure Indicators:**
- Logical progression from basic to advanced
- Each lesson builds on previous
- Appropriate lesson length (10-15 min each)
- Clear section breaks
- Summary and practice in each lesson

⚠️ **Structure Issues to Address:**
- Topics in random order
- Lessons too long or too short
- Missing prerequisites
- No practice opportunities
- Abrupt transitions

**2. Content Quality Assessment**

✅ **Good Content Indicators:**
- Accurate technical information
- Clear, beginner-friendly language
- Practical, relevant examples
- Real-world applications shown
- Screenshots/visuals included

⚠️ **Content Issues to Address:**
- Technical inaccuracies
- Overly complex explanations
- Abstract examples without context
- Missing visuals
- Jargon not explained

**3. Pedagogical Approach Assessment**

✅ **Good Pedagogy Indicators:**
- Clear learning objectives stated
- Hands-on practice opportunities
- Multiple examples showing variety
- Progressive difficulty
- Encouragement and motivation

⚠️ **Pedagogical Issues to Address:**
- Unclear objectives
- No practice exercises
- Only one example given
- Everything same difficulty
- Discouraging tone

**4. Technical Accuracy Assessment**

✅ **Technical Quality Indicators:**
- Code examples tested and working
- ChatGPT prompts produce expected results
- Instructions are reproducible
- Common errors addressed
- Best practices included

⚠️ **Technical Issues to Address:**
- Code doesn't work
- Prompts get unexpected results
- Steps missing or unclear
- No error handling mentioned
- Poor practices shown

### Support Options Menu:

- Suggest structure improvements
- Help refine explanations

**For Technical Challenges:**
- Test code examples together
- Troubleshoot ChatGPT prompts
- Provide HTML/CSS resources
- Set up testing environment

**For Time Management:**
- Adjust timeline realistically
- Break work into smaller milestones
- Prioritize core content over extras
- Remove non-essential requirements

**For Skill Development:**
- Provide training on course design
- Share instructional design resources
- Mentor through first course creation
- Build confidence through positive feedback

**For Tool/Access Issues:**
- Verify account access
- Provide tool tutorials
- Set up preview environment
- Troubleshoot technical problems

### Issue Escalation Protocol:

**Minor Issues (Handle Directly)**
- Questions about content
- Request for feedback
- Need for additional resources
- Preference for timeline adjustment

**Moderate Issues (Involve Design Lead)**
- Significant delays (> 1 week over estimate)
- Major content gaps discovered
- Scope creep (requirements unclear)
- Quality concerns needing expert review

**Major Issues (Escalate to Management)**
- Designer blocked completely
- Project infeasible as scoped
- Resource constraints preventing completion
- Fundamental skills gap identified

### Process Improvement Capture:

Document learnings for future assignments:

**What Worked Well:**
- [e.g., Clear briefing document was very helpful]
- [e.g., Having tutorial video with timestamps was efficient]
- [e.g., Early check-in caught issues before they grew]

**What Could Improve:**
- [e.g., Provide course structure template upfront]
- [e.g., Include more code example templates]
- [e.g., Set clearer milestones for check-ins]

**Resources That Helped:**
- [e.g., Reference to similar existing course]
- [e.g., Instructional design guidelines]
- [e.g., Quick feedback on outline before full development]

**Blockers Encountered:**
- [e.g., ChatGPT account limits hit]
- [e.g., Academy platform access delayed]
- [e.g., Unclear success criteria initially]

**Recommendations for Next Assignment:**
- [e.g., Provide template with section structure]
- [e.g., Schedule kickoff call to align expectations]
- [e.g., Set 3 check-in points at 25%, 50%, 75%]

### Quality Assurance Checklist:

After monitoring session, verify:

□ Progress check-in completed (message sent or call held)
□ Current status documented in Notion
□ Any blockers identified and support offered
□ Timeline confirmed or adjusted
□ Feedback provided on drafts (if available)
□ Resources shared as needed
□ Next check-in scheduled
□ Process improvement notes captured
□ Designer feels supported (not micromanaged)
□ Realistic path to completion established
