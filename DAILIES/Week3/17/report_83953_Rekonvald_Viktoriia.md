# Daily Report - November 17, 2025 - Rekonvald Viktoriia

## Summary

- **Total work time:** ~3 hours (≈2h research, ≈1h Telegram/admin)
- **Main focus:** 
  - Deep research and processing of Video_016.
  - Capturing Niko’s instructions about GPT‑5.1 tools and workflows.
  - Telegram HR admin tasks (contracts, scheduled messages).

---

## 1. Activities Completed

### 1.1 Deep Research & Processing of Video_016

- Found and opened Video_016 (via Perplexity / Videos library).
- Ran the transcript through existing video/research prompts:
  - `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS/PROMPTS/Video_Processing`
  - `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS/PROMPTS/Research Prompts`
- Extracted:
  - Tools mentioned in the video.
  - Workflows and step-by-step processes.
  - Actions and objects relevant for TASK_MANAGERS libraries.
- Documented results in:
  - `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS/RESEARCHES/Videos/Video_016.md` (and related reports).
  - `notes.md` (short high-level summary and next steps).

### 1.2 Documentation of Niko’s Lesson (GPT‑5.1 + Tools)

- Captured main ideas from the call:
  - Switch to GPT‑5.1 era tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini) for HR and research.
  - Use **VS Code + Cursor + Claude/Cloud extensions** on different accounts.
  - Avoid **Windsurf** for now due to hardware limitations.
  - Updated Task Manager ecosystem: tasks from different chats → phases/steps → single system, including video research.
- Wrote step-by-step workflow in `notes.md`:
  - Tool setup (VS Code, Cursor, extensions).
  - Video research process using prompts and Plan Mode in Cursor.
  - How to feed research results back into TASK_MANAGERS (data population).

### 1.3 Telegram HR Admin Work

- Opened main HR channels and personal chats in Telegram.
- Added/verified contracts for relevant candidates/employees.
- Scheduled follow-up messages and reminders.

## 2. Outcomes

- **Video_016**:
  - Processed and ready for deeper integration into TASK_MANAGERS libraries (tools, workflows, task templates).
- **Procedure documented**:
  - Clear working instructions in `notes.md` for:
    - Running video research.
    - Using AI tools (GPT‑5.1, Cursor, Claude Code) safely on current hardware.
    - Connecting research to TASK_MANAGERS.
- **HR communication**:
  - Contracts and Telegram follow-ups prepared and scheduled.

## 3. Issues & Constraints

- Laptop becomes overloaded when VS Code and Windsurf run together:
  - Decision: temporarily **avoid Windsurf**; focus on VS Code + Cursor + Claude/Cloud stack.
- Need a simple tracking mechanism:
  - Suggestion: use **Excel/Google Sheets** to track:
    - Which videos have been processed.
    - Which prompts were applied.
    - Status (planned / in progress / completed).

## 4. Next Steps (Tomorrow)

1. Continue collecting **HR research topics** (videos + prompts) to populate `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS`.
2. Start integrating **Video_016 findings** into TASK_MANAGERS:
   - Add/update tools.
   - Add/update workflows.
   - Propose new task templates where useful.
3. Check **scheduled Telegram messages**:
   - Process replies.
   - Update candidate/employee statuses in the **CRM**.

## 5. Reflection

- Today was focused on **learning and system setup**, not just execution:
  - Understanding how GPT‑5.1 and modern AI IDE tools can support HR work.
  - Creating a repeatable process for video-based research and knowledge capture.
- The next phase is to **turn research into structure**:
  - TASK_MANAGERS entities.
  - HR workflows and templates.
  - Stable daily routines supported by AI tools.
