## Task 1: Fix Catalog Documentation Issues


### Steps:
1. Open catalog documentation file
2. Review entire document systematically
3. Identify all missing icons (mark locations where icons should be)
4. Identify all duplicate entries (compare entries side by side)
5. Create list of missing icons needed
6. Source or create missing icons
7. Insert icons into correct locations
8. Remove duplicate entries (keep most complete/accurate version)
9. Review document again to ensure completeness
10. Get approval/review from team lead


### Resources and Links:
- Catalog documentation file location
- Icon library/resources (GitHub repositories, Dropbox folders)
- Design team resources


### Instructions:

Start by opening the catalog documentation file. Go through it section by section, marking every location where an icon is missing. Create a checklist of missing icons. Then, go through again to identify duplicates - compare entries carefully to determine which version is most complete or accurate. Once you have the list of missing icons, check GitHub repositories and Dropbox folders for existing icons that can be used. If icons don't exist, note what needs to be created. Insert all icons into their correct locations. Remove duplicate entries, keeping only the best version of each. Do a final review to ensure everything is complete and correct before submitting for review.

## Task 2: Create Video Tutorials for AI-Assisted Design


### Steps:
1. Review existing lesson content and structure
2. Create video script/outline for each tutorial topic:
   - GitHub repository setup and management
   - Live Server plugin installation and use
   - Creating lessons in Online Academy
   - Using AI to generate HTML/CSS code
   - Editing code in VS Code
   - Translating content with AI
   - File organization and locations
3. Set up screen recording software
4. Record each tutorial separately
5. Edit videos (add captions, highlights, annotations)
6. Upload videos to appropriate platform
7. Create index/documentation linking all tutorials
8. Share with team


### Resources and Links:
- Screen recording software (OBS, Loom, or similar)
- Video editing software
- Online Academy platform
- GitHub admin access
- VS Code
- AI platform access (GPT/ChatGPT)


### Instructions:

Start by creating a detailed outline for each video tutorial. Each video should be focused on one specific topic to keep them manageable and easy to reference. For the GitHub tutorial, cover: creating repositories, editing files, uploading files, committing changes, deleting repositories, and understanding repository structure. For the AI code generation tutorial, demonstrate the full workflow: copying content, pasting to AI, writing clear prompts, iterating on results, and pasting final code into Full HTML blocks. For the VS Code editing tutorial, show how to open files, review code structure, understand HTML/CSS classes, and make edits (colors, animations, etc.). Record each tutorial separately, keeping them concise but complete. Add captions and annotations to highlight important points. Upload to a shared location and create an index document that links all tutorials with brief descriptions.

## Task 3: Document AI Prompt Templates


### Steps:
1. Review previous lessons and projects
2. Extract all prompts used for AI code generation
3. Categorize prompts by type (cards, animations, layouts, etc.)
4. Document prompt structure and key elements
5. Create example prompts for each category
6. Document best practices for writing effective prompts
7. Include examples of iterations and refinements
8. Format as reference document
9. Share with team


### Resources and Links:
- Previous lesson files
- Online Academy project files
- AI platform (GPT/ChatGPT)
- Team documentation repository


### Instructions:

Go through all previous lessons and projects to find examples of prompts used with AI. Look for patterns in successful prompts - what made them effective? Categorize prompts by the type of output they generate: flip cards, hover animations, keyboard combinations, card layouts, etc. For each category, create a template showing the structure and key elements needed. Include 2-3 example prompts for each category showing different variations. Document best practices: be specific about visual requirements, describe desired behavior clearly, mention styling preferences, and provide context. Include examples showing how prompts were refined through iteration to get better results. Format everything as a clear reference document that team members can use as a guide when working with AI.

## Task 4: Complete Online Academy Module 4


### Steps:
1. Review current status of Module 4 (chat module)
2. Identify what's missing or incomplete
3. Create lesson content for missing parts
4. Generate necessary code using AI if needed
5. Test all interactive elements
6. Review and refine content
7. Integrate into course structure
8. Publish module


### Resources and Links:
- Online Academy platform
- Module 4 files and resources
- AI platform for code generation
- Previous module examples for consistency


### Instructions:

Check the current state of Module 4. Review what content exists and what's missing. Based on the module topic (chat), determine what lessons or components need to be created. Use the AI-assisted workflow learned today: create content, generate code using AI with clear prompts, test functionality, and refine. Ensure consistency with other modules in terms of styling and structure. Once complete, integrate into the course and publish.

## Task 5: Create File Organization Documentation


### Steps:
1. List all locations where design files are stored
2. Document GitHub repository structure
3. Document Dropbox folder organization
4. Create index of repositories and their purposes
5. Document how to find specific types of files
6. Include access instructions
7. Create visual map/diagram if helpful
8. Share documentation with team


### Resources and Links:
- GitHub repositories
- Dropbox folders
- Design team file locations
- Admin access information


### Instructions:

Create a comprehensive guide to file organization. Start by listing all GitHub repositories and what they contain. Document the folder structure in Dropbox. Create an index showing: repository/folder name, purpose, what files it contains, and how to access it. Include information about shared libraries, test versions that should be deleted, and where to find specific resources like UI kits. Make it easy for team members to quickly find what they need. Include any access requirements (admin login, etc.).

## Task 6: Monitor Time Tracker


### Steps:
1. Use time tracker daily
2. Document any issues that occur
3. Note specific problems (timer won't stop, can't submit reports, etc.)
4. Take screenshots when issues occur
5. Report issues to technical support
6. Track patterns (does it happen on specific days/times?)
7. Document workarounds if found
8. Keep records of all time entries and reports


### Resources and Links:
- Time tracker platform
- Technical support contact
- Screenshot tool
- Discord/communication channel for reporting


### Instructions:

Use the time tracker consistently and pay attention to any glitches. When issues occur (like the Friday problem where the timer wouldn't stop), document exactly what happened: what you were trying to do, what the system did instead, what you tried to fix it, and whether anything worked. Take screenshots of error messages or unusual behavior. Report issues promptly to technical support. Look for patterns - does it happen on certain days, at certain times, or with certain projects? Keep detailed records of all your time entries and reports in case you need to reference them later.
