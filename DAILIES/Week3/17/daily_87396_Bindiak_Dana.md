Cleaned transcript:
- "I'm copying this now. I don't want to install anything. Let's see if the session metrics are okay. Going up and choosing what to insert specifically. I can just do it like this. There are accounts, but we won't load all of them."
- "I'll set the path; let's take your Inna folder. There's a copy. It needs to start with LC. Dropbox? Yes. And this plan—do we pick it or not? Nothing extra to pick. I'm just curious where it creates and which folder."
- "Output format: replace the file. Replace. This will be 15. 'Rosa'—is that how it's spelled? Yes. Export set right away. I'll copy it now. Send it?"
- "This one is just for Marina; I need Inna. Maybe the original prompt is in that Marina file? Everything else is here—it even has location and account. That's it. Thanks!"


**Outcomes:**
- Course folder created and populated with updated lessons
- Lead gen training materials organized for team access

**What I worked on:**
- Worked on a prompt to analyze uploaded LinkedIn communications
- Pre-checked and analyzed the uploaded files before full processing

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Cleaned transcript:
- "We should keep an example so it's clear it's just a sample and shouldn't be included."
- "Looking for the prompt he created so I can record it—still learning."
- "Question on the 'priority account process' line: keep it or remove? It reads logically, everything is described."
- "Can't find the subtitles; checking Whisper history for recorded names/dates (around Nov 11/13)."
- "Found a short one; let's try it. Copied. Should we keep the 'priority account process' bit? No."
- "Choose plan mode; leave 'ask before edit' on. Watch closely and stop if something goes wrong."
