## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**

Today's work focused on three main areas:
1. **GitHub Repository Management**: Learned how to create, edit, and delete repositories, set up Live Server plugin, and understand repository structure
2. **Online Academy Lesson Creation**: Created lessons using Full HTML content type, used AI to generate interactive code elements (flip cards, animations), and learned the workflow for AI-assisted design
3. **Catalog Documentation**: Identified missing icons and duplicate entries that need to be fixed

Key learnings:
- Repository vs Project distinction clarified
- Full HTML content type is primary method for course content
- AI can effectively generate code when given clear, specific requirements
- Time tracker had technical issues that need monitoring
- Need better documentation of file locations and organization
