## Notes

Total work time today: **~3 hours** (about 2 hours of research + 1 hour of Telegram/admin work).

Focus of the day: training with Niko (GPT‑5.1, Cursor/VS Code stack), deep processing of Video_016 and basic HR admin tasks in Telegram.

## Issues & Challenges

* Laptop becomes overloaded when running VS Code + Windsurf at the same time → decided to temporarily **avoid using Windsurf**.
* Need to carefully track which prompts and videos have already been processed, so a simple tracking table in Excel/Sheets is required.

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Continue collecting topics for HR research (videos/prompts) to populate `ENTITIES/TASK_MANAGERS`.
2. Start integrating the results from Video_016 into TASK_MANAGERS (tools, workflows, task templates).
3. Check scheduled messages in Telegram and update statuses in the CRM when people reply.
