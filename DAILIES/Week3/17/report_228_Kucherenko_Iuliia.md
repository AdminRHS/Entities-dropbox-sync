## 2️⃣ Challenges & Solutions – Any issues you faced and how you solved them

### Challenge: Time Tracker Technical Issues
**Problem:** On Friday, the time tracker experienced glitches where:
- Timer wouldn't stop when attempting to exit
- Unable to submit reports
- Timer continued running even after attempting to pause or take breaks
- System requested multiple screenshots at unusual times (2 AM)
- Timer accumulated 23 hours before finally stopping

**Solution:**
- Documented all issues with specific details and timestamps
- Reviewed work hours and reports with supervisor to verify accuracy
- Confirmed that work hours were correctly recorded despite tracker issues
- Will continue monitoring time tracker behavior and report recurring issues
- Taking screenshots when issues occur for technical support reference

### Challenge: Understanding Repository Structure
**Problem:** Initial confusion about the difference between repositories and projects, and how they relate to folders and files.

**Solution:**
- Clarified through discussion: Repository = shared folder name containing projects
- Project = content inside repository that displays in the repository
- Understood that repositories are like root folders containing multiple files/projects
- Documented the distinction for future reference

### Challenge: Catalog Documentation Issues
**Problem:** Discovered missing icons and duplicate entries in catalog documentation.

**Solution:**
- Systematically reviewed catalog documentation
- Identified all locations with missing icons
- Found and marked duplicate entries for review
- Created action plan to fix issues (Task 1 in task breakdown)
- Will source or create missing icons from GitHub repositories and Dropbox folders

### Challenge: Need for Better Documentation
**Problem:** Lack of organized documentation for:
- AI prompt templates and variations
- File locations and organization
- Workflow processes

**Solution:**
- Created prioritized action items to address documentation gaps
- Planned video tutorial series to capture knowledge
- Set deadlines for documentation tasks (end of week for high priority items)
