## Activities

### [9:00 - 13:25] - [Course Images & Daily Meeting]
**What I worked on:**
- Adjusted course images to correct sizes using Firefly.
- Attempted to create animations for modules using Runway and ChatGPT prompts (process was slow and result was not ideal).
- Attended Daily meeting with Team Lead Yulia and EvilGame.
- **Outcomes from Daily:**
    - Animation task postponed.
    - Assigned Test Task: Redesign Home page and create booklets (Target deadline: Tuesday).
    - Discussed upcoming Lead Gen training (scheduled for 3:00 PM).
    - Clarified role: I will also be generating images along with lead generators.
- Conducted DeepResearch using Gemini on website flaws for the test task.
- Requested prompts for Lovable and Claude to generate design concepts.

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
[Yesterday I received a task to make images for the course, specifically to make them the correct sizes and create animations for the modules. So I continued working on this task. I adjusted the images to the needed sizes using Firefly. Then I started making the animation for the module using Runway. I wrote the prompt via ChatGPT. The animation took a very long time because it was supposed to be a short animation, but it took a long time and still didn't turn out the way I needed. So I shouldn't do this. Then I was taken to the Daily meeting via Zoom with my Team Lead Yulia and EvilGame, where they asked me what I was doing, how my tasks were going, etc. They looked and said everything is super in general. They said I can do the animation later because they assigned a test task that needs to be done, ideally by Tuesday, though formally by Wednesday. So there's that. We also discussed that I was supposed to teach the Lead Generators how to create images. They told me it would likely be today at 3:00. But there were some slight changes in that I, as a designer, will also be generating these images, and EvilGame will also be involved with me and the lead generators. So they told me I can do the animation later and can work on the test task, in which I needed to create a Redesign of the Home page and also make a couple of booklets. I did DeepResearch using Gemini about the website's flaws. And based on this DeepResearch, I asked for a prompt for Lovable and Claude to create my own design and redesign of the website. Well, I didn't particularly like what Gemini made for me, so I decided to redo it later anyway.]

**Outcomes:**
- Course images resized.
- Daily meeting completed; priorities aligned.
- Test task started (Research phase).

### [14:22 - 18:00] - [Training Prep, Test Task & Tool Setup]
**What I worked on:**
- Prepared for the Lead Gen training session (scheduled for 3 PM):
    - Created a plan and notes using a chatbot.
    - Generated example prompts for lead generators.
- Training call did not happen (cancelled/no one gathered).
- Continued working on the Test Task:
    - Decided to try using the chatbot for the design since Gemini/Lovable/Claude results were mixed.
    - Result is better but needs more work; banners also need to be done. Estimated to take until Monday.
- Troubleshooting Communication Tools:
    - Clarified with Team Leads about Whisper Flow issues in Discord (only records me or no one).
    - Installed and tested an alternative tool used by videographers; it works.
    - Plan: Use alternative tool for calls, Whisper Flow for reports.
- Antigravity Setup:
    - Clarified setup instructions (admin account); confirmed it was already installed and working.

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
[Since I was supposed to have this session at 3 PM where I was supposed to teach lead generators how to make images, I decided to prepare. So with the help of a chatbot, I decided to sketch out a small plan of how I would do it, what I would show them. And I made some small notes for myself so I wouldn't forget to say something. I also asked the chatbot to throw me a couple of examples of what prompts, i.e., tasks, can be given to lead generators to see how the work goes and how images are generated, etc. But for some reason, the call didn't take place, and no one gathered me anywhere. So I just continued working on the test task. Since I really liked the result that was in Gemini, and accordingly then in Lovable and Claude, I decided to try to do all the same things only through the chatbot. It's already a little better, but there's still a lot to do, plus I'll need to make banners too. So yes, this will take me into Monday. In general, I also clarified with the lead generator... oh, team leads. Since Whisper Flow doesn't work for me specifically in Discord when I record in headphones, it only records me. If I record without headphones, I don't hear anyone, and it doesn't record anyone, even me. So I asked what can be used instead, as I remember that the team lead from videographers used something else. I decided to clarify what it was. They told me what it was, and I installed it, tested it — everything works. So I will use not Whisper Flow during calls and various activities. I will use Whisper Flow when I record the report and so on. I also clarified about Antigravity, as yesterday it was very unclear what to do with it at all, which account to log in through, etc. They told me that it needs to be installed via the admin account, but I already had it installed, so I just changed it through another account and set everything up. And so on.]

**Outcomes:**
- Prepared training materials (Plan & Prompts).
- Progressed on Test Task (Design iteration).
- Resolved Discord recording issue with new tool.
- Verified Antigravity setup.
