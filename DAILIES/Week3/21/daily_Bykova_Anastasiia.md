**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[You need to work properly. So just from the first years, for example, what you did further in this style, we immediately gave you corrections. Uh-huh. That makes sense... And I also forgot to say, today at three o'clock you will have a call with designers and lead generators. They will tell you again about Hidemy FM, they will tell you again how to create images. The main task will be to teach you, they will ask you to make a presentation for this course, a social carousel. Ah, well, do you have a big table there? Vil, there in our table, right, there's a table attached to this task? Well yes, yes, there's a table attached that needs to be filled in. Yes, there you basically make a presentation that will then be placed on this site. After the presentation, uh, social posts. This is in vertical format. Ah, then for generators. How to do this? Yes, they know how or not. Ah, then you will create images that will relate to the "RHS" project. Well, Wilhelm will tell you a bit about what and how, will answer. Just so you're ready that at three o'clock there will be a call, so you can go to lunch break, have time before that. Uh-huh, understood. Uh-huh. So, I've let you go. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, that's all. Then go work. Have a nice day! Thank you! Good! Have a nice day! Thank you! Thank you! Yes, as for REALS format. Then you develop the carousel first, and then you animate this carousel through Wifi accordingly. Well, if you look, maybe through Capcut or through Canva free version you can put these pieces together into a single whole, right? So try yourself, if you can't, then we'll give what we get for editing to video editors, right. And then after that there will still need to make covers for the course, right? Ah, what they should be... ah, for the site itself. There are many stages. Well, I think for now at least it's more or less clear. And then we'll correct you if something. I think there's already too much here that still needs to be done. Uh-huh, understood. Well, I've already made covers. I can show to, uh, understand correctly whether I did it right or not. Yes, let's. Now. Here, for example, such a cover. Normal. Just here try to make... We have on admin, on rad-- on admin we have paid Firefly, ah, and it can expand the image for you. Or I saw people use AI Studio, and they expand the image the same way so there's more, you know, of the landscape itself. There, of course, it may not be visible, but it's desirable to have trees, a bit of nest, something like that. Ah, understood. Just painted brown, and the background itself, so that in case, for example, on our site this thing will automatically... What darkening for the image to put text on top so it works best, so it's desirable to make the actual image itself like the actual background that is currently there. So should I redo this? Preferably yes. Uh-huh. Well, well... Like this. I think it's not that difficult. I'm telling you, through AI studio or through Firefly, which is on the admin account. Uh-huh, good. But it works. Yes. Uh-huh. Well, yes. Is there anything else to show? To check? Well, no, no. Aha. Yes, it's normal. Everything works fine, yes just, there some... First, like, for example, so you don't do it in this style further, we immediately gave you corrections. Uh-huh. Yes, yes. All then, turn off. And I also forgot to say, today at three o'clock you will have a call with designers and lead generators. They will tell you again, this is in "Guide me fm", they will tell you again how to create images. Well, the main task will be, like, to teach... Ah, then for generators. How to do this? Yes, do they know how or not. Ah, then you will create images that will relate to the "RHS" project. Well, Wilhelm will tell you a bit about what and how. They will answer. Just so you're ready that at three o'clock there will be a call. So you can go to lunch break, have time before that. Uh-huh, understood. Uh-huh. So, I've let you go. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, that's all. Then go work. Have a nice day! Yes, good. Have a nice day. Thank you for the call.]
