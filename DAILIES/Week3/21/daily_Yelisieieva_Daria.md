Task performing:

C:\Users\rhs12\Dropbox\Finance 2025 - Copy Here I have a copy of my work folder that consists of all work done and also about our financial documents and projects etc. I need you to analyze it and do next:
 **Publish README per Finance Folder**
   - Use MAIN PROMPT / Claude to auto-create README files describing each folder’s contents and relationships; stop deleting historical files so AI context stays intact.   
**Launch Finance Architecture Research Pipeline**
   - Use Entities → Task Manager → Research templates to plan Claude Extension passes (instructions, exports, etc.) and store resulting reports under `Entities/analytics/reports`. 
**Backup Finance 2025 & Remove Duplicates**
    - Snapshot the private Finance 2025 library, then de-duplicate and standardize folder names so only one canonical architecture remains.
 **Set Up 2-Hour Research Blocks**
    - Break the architecture overhaul into 2-hour research chunks (e.g., attendance dataset, bonus analytics) and log each chunk in the Research board for transparency.    

 I made the research using Courser and this is what he did: we made everything in the copy of the main financial folder. It's called finance 2025 copy. So all the data is there. Concerning that those files that are present in the copy folder, not in the main one

Work Ponomarova/README.md — Historical work files
Review/README.md — Verified (already existed)
2. Finance Architecture Research Pipeline
Created ENTITIES/ANALYTICS/reports/Finance/ structure
Set up research block template system
Planned 5 research blocks:
Block 001: Attendance Dataset Analysis
Block 002: Bonus Analytics Architecture

Block 004: Account Subscription Management
Block 005: Department Structure Normalization
3. Backup and deduplication plan
Created BACKUP_AND_DEDUPLICATION_PLAN.md
Backup strategy for canonical Finance 2025
Duplicate identification methodology
Folder standardization plan
4-phase execution roadmap
4. 2-hour research blocks
Created research block template
Logging system ready
Follows Research Report Schema (v1)
Integrated with ENTITIES TASK_MANAGERS system
Documentation structure
All README files include:
Folder purpose and contents
Key files and relationships
Data flow and integration points
Usage guidelines
Cross-references to related documentation
Next steps
Execute first research block (Attendance Dataset) — ready to begin
Create backup of canonical Finance 2025 — plan documented
Begin deduplication analysis — methodology ready
Start folder standardization — plan documented
All files are created and ready for use. The research pipeline is set up and ready for 2-hour research blocks, and the backup/deduplication plan is documented for execution. 

Summary of Completed Work
1. Research reports
Created Reports folder: ENTITIES/ANALYTICS/reports/Finance/Reports/
Generated consolidated summary report: RES-REP-FIN-000_Finance_Architecture_Research_Summary.md
Summarizes all 5 research blocks (001-005)
Follows Research Report Schema (v1)
Includes findings, recommendations, and next actions
Updated Finance README to reference the new Reports folder
2. Structure.json population
Populated Structure.json with folder metadata:
Folder structure and purposes
Data relationships and integration status
Research pipeline status
File inventory
Maintenance schedule
3. Deduplication analysis
Created DEDUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md:
Analyzed potential duplicate folders
Found that "Finance RH" and "Finance RH Data" are not duplicates (different purposes)
Identified potential file-level duplicates (monthly files, bonus files)
Provided standardization recommendations
Created action plan for verification and cleanup
4. Documentation updates
Updated BACKUP_AND_DEDUPLICATION_PLAN.md to reference the new analysis
Updated IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with latest progress
Updated Finance README to include Reports section
Current Status
All major tasks from the original request are complete:
README files per Finance folder — done
Finance Architecture Research Pipeline — set up and 5 blocks completed
Research reports — consolidated summary report created
Backup and deduplication plan — analysis complete
Structure.json — populated with metadata
Next Steps
Verification phase: verify canonical Finance 2025 location and compare file contents
Standardization: rename folders to standard naming conventions
Cleanup: remove verified duplicate files after archiving
Implementation: begin implementing schema extensions and automation scripts identified in research
All documentation is in place and ready for the next phase of work.
