## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The day focused on three main areas: design team task management and review, comprehensive training on the company's taxonomy system and video transcription workflow, and hands-on practice with AI design tool video processing. Skrypkar Vilhelm participated in morning design team check-ins where Black Friday promotional banners and course materials were reviewed, then received extensive training from the administration on how to properly structure prompts in the company's taxonomy database and conduct deep research on AI design tools through video transcription. The training resulted in successful transcription and taxonomy integration of two design AI tutorial videos, with a prioritized list established for upcoming video processing work. A new initiative was discussed to train lead generators on generating social media post images while designers learn to create the accompanying content.

- **Owner:** Anastasiya Kovalska (coordinator), Management/AI team (methodology development)
- **Suggested Resolution:** Either:
  1. Create standardized prompt/template for content generation
  2. Provide examples and let designers research/develop approach
  3. Schedule joint training sessions for collaborative learning
- **Timeline:** Should be resolved before next work week to maintain momentum

### Dependency: Video Transcription on Second Video Completion
- **Context:** During training session, Skrypkar was released from administration chat while second video transcription was still processing
- **Status:** Transcription completion occurred after session ended, fully processed by end of day
- **Impact:** Minor - Did not block other work
- **Resolution:** Video_018.md completed successfully

## 14. KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS

### Insight: Video Transcription as Knowledge Acquisition Method
- **Learning:** Transcribing and processing AI tool tutorial videos is an effective method for building structured, actionable knowledge base
- **Application:** Not just passive documentation - actively extracts tools, workflows, steps, benefits, and profession mappings that can be directly applied by designers
- **Value:** Transforms scattered video content into structured taxonomy entries that are discoverable and actionable
- **Scalability:** Process can be repeated with prioritized video queue to continuously update team knowledge

### Insight: Deep Research Before Processing
- **Learning:** Using Perplexity AI for upfront research creates a prioritized, relevant video queue rather than ad-hoc processing
- **Application:** Ensures focus on current, high-value content
- **Benefit:** More efficient use of transcription time, better ROI on knowledge acquisition effort

### Insight: Centralized Taxonomy Structure Benefits
- **Learning:** Moving from individual Dropbox folders to centralized taxonomy database dramatically improves knowledge discoverability and sharing
- **Application:** Prompts, reports, and structured knowledge accessible to entire company rather than siloed
- **Benefit:** Reduces redundant work, enables knowledge reuse, facilitates onboarding and training

### Insight: Role Clarification Prevents Scope Creep
- **Learning:** Clarifying that designers create full posts (image + text) while lead generators learn only image generation prevents skill overlap and maintains role clarity
- **Application:** Each team develops appropriate depth in their domain
- **Benefit:** More efficient training, clear responsibility boundaries, appropriate skill depth per role

## 15. ANALOGIES & FRAMEWORKS

### Analogy: Taxonomy as Company Brain
- **Context:** Training on taxonomy system structure
- **Analogy:** The taxonomy database functions like a company's collective brain - storing memories (prompts, workflows), organizing knowledge (structured categories), and making it retrievable when needed
- **Application:** Just as brain neurons connect concepts, taxonomy links tools → professions → workflows → products
- **Insight:** Individual knowledge in personal folders is like isolated neurons - valuable but not networked. Taxonomy integration creates the neural connections that make knowledge useful company-wide.

### Framework: Video → Knowledge → Action Pipeline
- **Context:** Video transcription workflow
- **Framework:** 
  1. **Discovery** (Research) → Perplexity AI finds relevant videos
  2. **Capture** (Transcription) → AI tools with standardized instructions extract content
  3. **Structure** (Processing) → Information organized into taxonomy categories
  4. **Integration** (Database) → Knowledge stored in accessible format
  5. **Distribution** (Application) → Insights shared with designers for action
- **Value:** Transforms passive video watching into active knowledge acquisition with measurable outputs
