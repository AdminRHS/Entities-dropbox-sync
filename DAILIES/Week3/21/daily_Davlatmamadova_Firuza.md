Copy any copy-paste text to Plants. Insert it into the code instead of the one you have there, okay? Delete it, yes? Delete it!

And here, write your plans briefly. Like the one about working with job sites. No, not here—write it inside the code. No, you can write it here too, you’re doing it right. Yes, write it here. Just write your plans.

Oh? Did you sign it? Did you make the “sign-in”? Open the dropdown below, where you have the arrow. Yes, the dropdown. Good. Is everything still okay? Yes, everything is fine, I just pressed Enter and something happened.

Now click there—you have a field, number one. In the plans section it should be "1", and you write it right there. Yes, here. Write it like this, and delete what you have there.

Press “Close.” Look, you have “close,” “generate,” and “close.” Yes, here you write it.

On the tag "Coscrape" close. Good, and now in the code write a command so it will analyze your plans and create an expanded text, with more detailed steps. You can write that right here, yes, in this plan. Write it completely—whatever you want, you can do it in English.

Danna, do you see this error we had above in the code? The red one—yes, this I'm telling Danna. Is Danna here? Yes. Okay.

And now it should remake this file. Okay. Task there, yes. Now go back to the Google chat. You want to go? Yes.

And this is for the 19th. If you can, make something similar for the 20th and 21st as well. You can write something like: “Make something similar but slightly different,” because it's a different day.

Here. Wait. Now from this, make tasks right here. Whatever you have—turn it into tasks. And here, yes? Yes. Insert them here.

Great, and here too, right? Insert these too, yes? And you also need the daily. I’ll send it to you in the chat—I recorded it as a Whisper.
