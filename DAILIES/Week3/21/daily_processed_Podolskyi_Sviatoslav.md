Sviatoslav Podolskyi onboarded Darya Azanova to the new "Antigravity" workflow, explaining the requirement to organize daily folders in Dropbox (specifically folder "21") and use WhisperFlow for recording activities. A workaround was established where Darya will save transcripts as text files for Sviatoslav to process, as she cannot run the automation tool herself.
