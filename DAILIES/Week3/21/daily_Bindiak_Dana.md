**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

You’ll see me on Monday and in that session. You’re definitely going on Gmaps. Who should we assign there? I think we can put Isaac on the scheduling task. Listen, we can check both options and assign people there and there.
— Yes, basically. Who else do we have?

Plamena will handle the active tasks. We’re not touching Ferzu because she’s doing the calls. And we also shouldn’t touch Isaac because he’s making calls too. But we need Vlada to try everyone and see which people fit him best. And I think Isaac will handle it well, because he has experience in prompt engineering. So he’s an ideal candidate no matter how you look at it.

And what about Lviv? What do you think?
— Not for Vlada, but maybe we can test someone on Maps.
— Damn, you can’t put anyone that weak under Vlada.
— Maybe me? I don’t know…
— Anya, wait. Who will stay on onboarding then?
— It’s only Monday, and this will be from next week.
— What do you mean “from next week”?
— You.

Anyway, I was also thinking: if he sends the instructions on how to scrape, we can share them with all managers. And in the worst case, we can rotate people—like two on one Monday, two on another. Otherwise he’ll keep sending tasks back, and it will be frustrating if the team lead doesn’t get the results he needs.

Yes, of course.
— Let me interrupt you. Ksyusha, Hanan wrote to me about what I put in the team lead chat. Someone wrote to her in the live stream chat saying they want to work as a chat operator. She’s asking what to do with that person. This was posted somewhere before.
— Yes, I remember someone shared it, but I don’t remember where.
— Where was it?
— Probably in news or the main folder. Or maybe it was deleted. I definitely saw it too.
— Was it in lead, Report, Welcome Rounds? Maybe in naming.
— Should I maybe ask Zhenya?

Hi Fanon, I cannot hear you.
— Oh yeah. In the stream chat someone said they would like to work as a chat operator. My question is: should I ask for their email, or what should I do? I remember that somewhere—probably in HR—Yevhenia posted an announcement about this, but I can’t find it. I’m trying.
— It’s in naming, Ksyusha.
— I was looking, I even searched in ZOO, but I can’t find anything related.
— Let’s try to find it. We’ll pause and then send it…

**Outcomes:**
- Alignment on updated workflow and sequencing of tasks.
- Action items noted for applying the prompts and reorganizing workflow accordingly.
