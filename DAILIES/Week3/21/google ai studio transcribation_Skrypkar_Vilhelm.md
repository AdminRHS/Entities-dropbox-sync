## 3. Word-for-Word Transcription

[00:00] While other AI art tools will leave you tweaking your prompts endlessly, Midjourney gives you advanced techniques that will give you real control over image generation. I'll start you off with the basics and then move over to the hidden techniques that will give you an edge.

[00:16] Now in the Explore page you can find the works created by other people, either for inspiration, for references, and other stuff. So once we scroll down you can see all the different styles created by Midjourney. And I could easily start liking these and making collections that I can later use to generate my own images.

[00:38] So say I really like this, I can just hover over it, click the heart, and now it goes in my Likes page. So these are the images I liked. If I don't like them anymore, I could just click again on the heart and it just disappears. So let's go back here.

[00:55] And we do have some options at the top. Right now I'm on Random, which is basically Midjourney creating a feed for me based on random images it selected. But if I want to see something really popular images, which a lot of people liked, I would go to the Hot tab. If I want to see what's really popular today, Top Day, Top Week, and Top Month. And then of course my Likes panel.

[01:22] Now what can you do with these images? Not only can you look at them, but if you go over each one and click on them, you can see the prompt that they used to generate this image. So that is the prompt right here. Clicking once on this puts it in my prompt bar, allowing me to create something similar with the exact words.

[01:45] Of course I can change this. So say I want to do... instead of a man, I want to do a woman. And let's add a few different stuff between the dark blue background and all of that. So I'm just going to hit enter and you can see it said submitted.

[02:03] Now I have a zero out of one in my Create tab. We'll go over there in a second. But while that's generating I do want to show you a bunch of other stuff that you can do. So below the prompt we have some keywords which may seem unfamiliar to you. These are what's called parameters in Midjourney. We're going to look at those later.

[02:36] It's really easy to use them. You can either use this bar up here in the slider format or you could type it in in the prompt. I'll show you all about that later. Below that you can use this image in your prompt as a reference. So you can use the entire image as a reference, the style of the image, and the prompt or the prompt that was used to generate this image.

[03:15] So say I wanted to use a style for this. I'm going to click on this clip right here. And now I'm just going to type in something very simple. Let's go with a woman. So just really simple, hit enter. It's going to generate it.

[04:59] So the Create tab is where you generate your images. So these are the two things that we kept earlier. This is with the prompt of that reference image. You can see that I don't have the reference down here. And I just changed man into woman. This is what I got. Quite different, but you can see just how detailed this is.

[05:30] Now for the one where I used the original image as reference, you can see that it's here. It looks pretty similar. Not identical, but pretty similar. Now if I can combine the two... I could click on this again, maybe go for something else, and then use one of my generations as reference.

[05:50] So I'm just going to click on this, it brought it up here. Now I'm going to click and drag one of the ones I made above. Maybe a couple. So I'm going to do two. We have the first one, let's put it on the character reference. I want my new character to look exactly like this character. And the second one, let's go with the style. So same prompt and everything. Let's hit enter and see what we're getting.

[06:59] Down here you can see apart from the prompt and all the other stuff, we have some creation actions. So we have Vary, which is when I ask Midjourney to give me different variations of this very image as like new generations. I can ask for it to be Subtle, so it's going to closely follow the structure and give me just slightly different versions. Or I could make it Strong and have it be a little bit more bolder with the different versions.

[07:32] Next let's look at Upscale. So say the quality is good, it's all perfect, but I do want it to be say a little bit more crisp, a little bit more detailed. I can go for Subtle, which is again when it's maintaining the structure of this original image, or I could let it get more Creative. So it might add some extra lines, maybe some extra details.

[08:01] The last one is me getting more images. I could Rerun this prompt, which is going to be the exact same thing but I will get different results. Or I could open this in the Editor and use some of the tools to fine tune the smaller parts and then have it rerun. For example, I will grab a paintbrush and just go over her eyes, have her eyes opened.

[09:45] Okay so now I have a bunch of creations to work with. And before I get into how to take this a step further, let's take a look at how we can Organize our work. So that goes all the way down here in the Organize tab. You can see all the stuff we made right below.

[10:15] I can make folders to organize my stuff. So let's go over here, Create Folder, say Human Subjects. And there is an option for Smart Folders, so it's going to detect what I'm looking for for this folder and just automatically put that in. Which I think is great. So search terms, let's go with woman, female subjects. And perhaps let's go with hyper-realistic ones.

[11:07] Next we have Profiles. Now whenever you unlock Personalization, which is after you've rated 40 images on Midjourney, you're going to have a profile. So now whatever I generate, unless I hide it, is going to show up on the Explore page for other people to see.

[15:53] Now let's go to the Tasks. Now the more you help Midjourney train their stuff by ranking images, you do get some perks for it. So perhaps you get faster generations, you get more points if you're working with the points.

[16:44] Now the one that I mentioned that you would want to work through to get that public profile is in the Personalize tab. So when you first start Midjourney, it's going to be locked. So mine is just off at the moment. And then once you rate 40 images according to what you like, it will unlock personalization for you.

[18:30] Now I want to go into adding how to go about writing prompts. So let's start with something very simple. I'm gonna go with a dolphin. Hit enter. It's going to use Midjourney's default style to get this going.

[19:06] Let's make it into a crazy prompt. So a dolphin... let's write a vintage dolphin in a suit filing taxes in an apartment in New York City. He is smoking a pipe and has a hat on. So now we're getting more specific.

[19:37] Now I'm going to click once on this to get the same prompt. Go over here and we have some options. First one is Image Size. You can make it into a Portrait, Landscape, or use the slider to go for a specific thing. I'm going to go with a Landscape for this example.

[19:58] We have the Models. We have the Standard model and then we have Raw. So think of it in terms of photography. With raw photography you're capturing in more details. And that's good if you want to really build up on that prompt.

[20:31] Then we have Versions. These are the different versions of Midjourney. Try to use the ones that are recent, they're better. Now Niji is more of like an anime style, more of like a drawing thing. So if you want to create cartoonish stuff, try to use the Niji things right here.

[20:58] And there is the Personalize thing that we mentioned. So if I want Midjourney to study my patterns as I'm going about this prompt, I could turn it on or turn it off.

[21:50] And these are the parameters that we were talking about earlier. So this here is Aspect Ratio, which would be short for AR. And then we have the Aesthetics. Starts with Stylization. Now this is the style that Midjourney will go through. The default is 100 but you can obviously change that to get more styles on there.

[22:45] Weirdness is how different and quirky your generations are. So by default it's on zero, but you can go all the way to 3000. And it's going to get more creative with how you design this.

[23:15] And then Variety or just Chaos is when you have different creations. So you can see when I generate a prompt I'm getting four different images. But they relatively look the same. If I want them to look completely different I would have to ask for more variation.

[23:39] Next we have Speed. How fast or how slow you want this to go. The slower it is, the more time it can put into your generations. The faster it is, it's going to give you less detail.

[24:44] Now you can see how whenever we add a prompt to Midjourney, it really goes a long way to make sure that you get the best details for your images. But sometimes you don't want that. Sometimes you want it to be a little blurry, perhaps for a background. That's when you can use the Stop parameter.

[24:53] And I will be trying that with another, perhaps the same prompt that we had right here. I'm just going to not include these references. So let's first run it as a regular thing. I don't have any parameters on, just my aspect ratio. Now let's run this again and then we're going to do --stop curly bracket. And this is going to be between 10 to 100.
