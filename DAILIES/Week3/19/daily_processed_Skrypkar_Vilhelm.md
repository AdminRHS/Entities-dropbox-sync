## 6. RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### Course Creation

**Rule/Practice:**
Always create proper folder hierarchy (Course → Module → Lessons) even for single-module courses, to maintain consistent structure and accommodate module cover images.

**Rationale:**
Module folder required for vertical animated cover image storage. Consistent structure across all courses simplifies management, publishing, and future modifications.

**Application:**
When creating course structure on Google Drive, always create: Course folder → Module folder(s) → Individual lesson folders, with Cover image subfolder at each level.

**Examples:**
Even if course has single module with 3 lessons, structure is: Course/Module_1/Lesson_1, Course/Module_1/Lesson_2, Course/Module_1/Lesson_3 (not Course/Lesson_1 directly).

**Affected Departments:**
Design Department (course creators)

**Template Integration:**
Standard folder template for all Game Academy courses

---

### Cover Image Uniqueness

**Rule/Practice:**
Check unique cover image spreadsheet before generating new covers, and add new cover details to spreadsheet after creation to prevent visual repetition across courses.

**Rationale:**
Prevents students from seeing identical or near-identical mascot poses, outfits, or activities across multiple courses, maintaining visual freshness and professional appearance.

**Application:**
Before generating course cover: review spreadsheet for previous designs. After generating new cover: add row documenting mascot outfit/pose/activity to prevent future repetition.

**Examples:**
If previous course showed Falcon mascot wearing blue shirt coding, next course should feature different outfit and activity (e.g., red shirt reviewing documents).

**Affected Departments:**
Design Department (course creators)

**Template Integration:**
Standard quality control step in course creation workflow

---

### Folder Organization Before Asset Creation

**Rule/Practice:**
Create complete folder structure with proper hierarchy before generating cover images, ensuring assets are saved in correct locations immediately upon creation.

**Rationale:**
Prevents files scattered in wrong locations, reduces time spent organizing later, ensures assets findable by publishing team, maintains consistent structure.

**Application:**
Complete steps 4-6 (folder structure, spreadsheet tracking, lesson organization) before beginning step 7 (cover image generation).

**Examples:**
Eleonora initially saved all lesson text in module folder; had to reorganize into individual lesson folders. Proper structure first prevents this rework.

**Affected Departments:**
Design Department (course creators)

**Template Integration:**
Workflow sequence enforces proper order

---

### Instruction Document as Intermediate Step

**Rule/Practice:**
Always create comprehensive instruction document from video transcription before breaking into lesson content, serving as source-of-truth reference.

**Rationale:**
Instruction document captures complete video content in organized form, enables review/validation before lesson creation, serves as reference if lesson restructuring needed, preserves knowledge if video becomes unavailable.

**Application:**
Transcribe video → Create full instruction document → Save in course folder → Then transform into separate lessons.

**Examples:**
Each course has instruction document in course folder root, plus separate lesson files in lesson subfolders derived from that instruction.

**Affected Departments:**
Design Department (course creators)

**Template Integration:**
Critical intermediate deliverable in workflow

---

### Task Assignment with Comprehensive Training

**Rule/Practice:**
When assigning complex multi-step tasks, provide comprehensive verbal explanation followed by written instructions with links to reference materials.

**Rationale:**
Complex workflows require both conceptual understanding (verbal) and step-by-step reference (written). Verbal builds understanding, written enables execution. Links to existing courses/materials reduce need to re-explain standards.

**Application:**
For complex task assignment: 1) Verbal walkthrough of process and reasoning, 2) Written summary of steps in chat/email, 3) Links to reference materials (courses, spreadsheets, folders).

**Examples:**
Vilhelm's training of Anastasiia: verbal explanation in Discord audio, followed by written text instructions with links to cover course, unique cover spreadsheet, course folder.

**Affected Departments:**
All departments (applies to any complex task assignment)

**Template Integration:**
Standard training and onboarding practice

## 7. PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Inconsistent Course Folder Structure

**Description:**
Course creators initially organizing files incorrectly - lesson content saved directly in module folder instead of individual lesson folders, or saving assets before creating proper folder hierarchy.

**Impact:**
- Disorganized files difficult to find
- Publishing team struggles to locate correct assets
- Rework needed to reorganize after creation
- Inconsistent structure across courses
- Time wasted on file management

**Root Cause:**
Complex folder hierarchy not immediately intuitive; creators start generating content before understanding full structure requirements.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Create template folder structure that can be duplicated
2. Require folder creation and spreadsheet tracking before content/asset generation
3. Provide visual diagram of folder hierarchy
4. Include folder structure verification in quality checklist
5. Peer review folder structure before major asset creation

**AI Solution Potential:**
- AI-powered folder structure generator (input course name, outputs complete hierarchy)
- Automated validation check (scans folder, identifies structure issues)
- AI assistant that guides through folder creation step-by-step

**Decision Made:**
Emphasize folder creation as explicit prerequisite steps (4-5) before asset creation steps (7-9). Vilhelm providing corrective feedback immediately when issues detected.

**Implementation Owner:**
- **Skrypkar Vilhelm** (ID: 333) - Design Department - Workflow enforcer, quality reviewer
- **Course creators** - Responsible for following structure

**Status:**
In Progress - Corrective guidance provided to Eleonora, proper training provided to Anastasiia upfront

**Documentation Needed:**
Visual folder structure diagram and template folder structure for duplication

### Problem: Cursor Daily Processing Inconsistent Performance

**Description:**
Nikolay Artemchuk's daily report processing workflow (taught Day 18) not working consistently across team members. Some users successfully generate daily_processed.md files, while others following identical steps do not get file creation.

**Impact:**
- Blocks affected users from using efficient AI-assisted workflow
- Creates inconsistent team experience with new tools
- Undermines confidence in workflow reliability
- May indicate silent failures for other users who haven't reported issues
- Slows adoption of company-wide daily reporting improvement

**Root Cause:**
Likely LLM configuration, API access, rate limiting, or model selection issues. Technical investigation required.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Escalate to Nikolay Artemchuk (AI Department) for technical diagnosis
2. Compare configurations between working and non-working setups
3. Check API keys, rate limits, model availability, Cursor version
4. Document solution for future troubleshooting
5. Update training materials if procedure needs refinement
6. Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

**AI Solution Potential:**
- Automated configuration checker (verifies all settings correct)
- Self-diagnostic tool for Cursor setup
- Clear error messages indicating specific configuration issues
- Setup wizard ensuring correct configuration from start

**Decision Made:**
Issue escalated to Nikolay Artemchuk after confirming user following correct procedure. Waiting for AI Department technical investigation and resolution.

**Implementation Owner:**
- **Nikolay Artemchuk** (ID: 37226) - AI Department - Technical troubleshooting and fix
- **Skrypkar Vilhelm** (ID: 333) - Design Department - First-line support and escalation
- **Sviatoslav Podolskyi** (ID: 299) - Video Department - Affected user providing test case

**Status:**
Escalated - Awaiting technical investigation and resolution from AI Department

**Documentation Needed:**
Troubleshooting guide for common Cursor daily processing issues, configuration requirements documentation

### Problem: Coordinating Multiple Course Creators on Same Video Library

**Description:**
Two designers (Anastasiia Bykova, Eleonora Safonova) working on creating courses from same pool of Loom videos. Risk of duplicate work, course overlap, or confusion about which videos assigned to whom.

**Impact:**
- Potential duplicate effort on same video
- Unclear task boundaries between designers
- Possible gaps where some videos not processed
- Coordination overhead to prevent conflicts

**Root Cause:**
Video library not pre-assigned; designers selecting videos as they go. Lack of central assignment tracking system.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Immediate:** Vilhelm manually assigned different videos to each designer (Eleonora got specific Polish-named video, Anastasiia got 2 Days recordings)
2. **Short-term:** Use course tracking spreadsheet to mark which videos assigned to whom
3. **Medium-term:** Create separate tracking tab for video library with assignment status (unassigned/assigned to X/completed by X)
4. **Process:** Designer claims video in tracking sheet before starting work, preventing duplicates

**AI Solution Potential:**
- Automated video assignment based on designer workload/capacity
- Video-to-course recommendation (suggests which videos cluster into single course)
- Duplicate detection (alerts if two designers processing same video)

**Decision Made:**
Manual assignment for immediate coordination; will implement tracking sheet improvement when capacity allows.

**Implementation Owner:**
- **Skrypkar Vilhelm** (ID: 333) - Design Department - Coordinator and assignment manager
- **Course creators** - Responsible for checking assignments before starting work

**Status:**
Immediate coordination handled; tracking improvement planned for future implementation

**Documentation Needed:**
Video library tracking tab in course spreadsheet with assignment columns

- Lead generators can continue with existing workflows temporarily
- Better training quality when trainer not rushed or interrupted
- Polina Bogun likely best trainer (capacity expected soon after onboarding presentation complete)

**Decision Maker:**
Skrypkar Vilhelm (coordinator) in response to Anastasiia Kovalska (requester)

**Impact:**
Low - Training delayed but materials ready, no urgent deadline, manageable with current workflows

**Timeline:**
When capacity available (likely within 1-2 weeks when Polina completes current tasks)

**Follow-up Required:**
- Monitor Polina Bogun's task completion
- Schedule training sessions when capacity identified
