## Course Creation Workflow Reference

### 11-Step Process (Quick Reference)

1. **Select Video** from Loom library
2. **Transcribe** video to text
3. **Create Instruction** document from transcript
4. **Create Folder Structure** (Course → Module → Lessons)
5. **Add to Tracking Spreadsheet**
6. **Transform into Lessons** (separate files in lesson folders)
7. **Generate Course Cover** (horizontal, check uniqueness)
8. **Generate Lesson Covers** (horizontal for each lesson)
9. **Generate Module Animation** (vertical 9:16, animated)
10. **Publish to OA-Y Platform**
11. **Create Social Media Materials** (after published)

### Key Standards

- **Folder Hierarchy:** Course → Module(s) → Lesson(s), with Cover image folders at each level
- **Module Description:** Small text file in module folder, not full lesson content
- **Cover Uniqueness:** Check spreadsheet before generation, add entry after creation
- **Mascot:** Falcon for all UI/UX courses
- **Animation:** Simple animation for module vertical covers
