## Plan Overview

This document describes the plan and structure for all work done in the `Week_3/18` folder.  
Use it as the single source of truth for what you want to achieve today, how the work is organized, and any important constraints or assumptions.

## Objectives for Day 18

Describe what you want to accomplish during this session/day in a bit more detail, not just as short labels.
For each objective, give a short explanation of what “done” means so it is easy to verify completion later.

- **Objective 1**: _Describe the first concrete goal for today and what the final result should look like._
- **Objective 2**: _Describe the second goal, including any dependencies or prerequisites._
- **Objective 3**: _Optional: add any stretch goals or nice-to-have tasks if time allows._

## Work Breakdown

Break your objectives into smaller, actionable tasks or phases.  
This section should make it clear in which order you plan to do things and what belongs together.

- **Phase 1 – Preparation**: _List tasks related to setup, gathering information, or clarifying requirements._
- **Phase 2 – Main Implementation**: _List the core tasks that deliver the main value for today._
- **Phase 3 – Validation & Review**: _List tasks for testing, review, cleanup, and documentation updates._

## Constraints and Assumptions

List any constraints (time, tools, access, data, external dependencies) and assumptions you are making.  
This helps explain later why certain decisions were taken or why some tasks were left out.

- **Constraints**: _E.g. limited time, specific tools you must use, or rules you must follow._
- **Assumptions**: _E.g. which data is available, what is already prepared, or what other people will deliver._

## Documentation & Notes Strategy

Explain briefly how you will use the markdown files in this folder so it stays consistent over the week.

- **`PLANNING.md`**: High-level plan, goals, phases, and constraints for this day.
- **`TASK.md`**: Detailed task tracking with dates, status, and notes.
- **`NOTES.md`**: Free-form notes, ideas, meeting notes, and quick thoughts during work.
- **`README.md`**: Short description of what this day’s folder is about and how to navigate it.
- **`FILES.md`**: Overview of all files in this folder and what each is responsible for.

## End-of-Day Reflection

At the end of the day, briefly reflect on what was done, what went well, and what should be improved next time.  
This section should have complete sentences so that future you (or someone else) can understand the context without guessing.

- **What was completed**: _Summarize which objectives were fully or partially achieved._
- **What blocked you**: _Note any blockers, missing information, or issues you hit._
- **What to do next**: _List the most important follow-up tasks to carry into the next day or session._
