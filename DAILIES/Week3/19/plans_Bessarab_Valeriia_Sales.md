## Time Management Plan
- **09:00 – 10:30**: Deep research and prep
- **10:30 – 12:00**: Discovery call + CRM logging
- **13:00 – 15:00**: Ex-client email sprint
- **15:00 – 18:00**: Ex-client sheet update, weekly archiving, inbox monitoring
- **Buffer**: 30 minutes reserved for unexpected client responses or extra documentation needs

---

## Risk Management
1. **Incomplete intel before call** – Mitigate by double-checking CRM and public sources; escalate any unknowns early.
2. **Delayed CRM updates** – Block calendar time immediately after calls for documentation.
3. **Low response from ex-clients** – Test alternative subject lines and reference concrete wins.
4. **Data mismatch between CRM and sheet** – Perform nightly cross-checks and leave comments tracking changes.

---

## Resources Needed
- Software: CRM, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Google Sheets, Dropbox, email client, video conferencing.
- Information: Historic call notes, case studies, news alerts, prior collaboration summaries.
- Team Support: Availability for quick approvals on follow-up materials and access to analytics dashboards.

---

## End-of-Day Review Questions
1. Did the discovery call produce clear next steps and are they logged?
2. Are CRM and the ex-client sheet perfectly aligned?
3. How many ex-clients responded or engaged with today’s emails?
4. Is weekly documentation stored in the correct Google Sheets and Dropbox folders?
5. What requires follow-up first thing tomorrow?

---

## Notes
- Keep recap emails short but link to detailed docs for context.
- Track open/reply rates from today’s outreach to inform next week’s messaging adjustments.
- Maintain consistent naming conventions so files remain searchable.

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities Preview
- Deliver promised follow-up materials and confirm next call slots.
- Continue nurturing ex-clients who reply to today’s outreach.
- Plan the next wave of research for upcoming first calls later in the week.
