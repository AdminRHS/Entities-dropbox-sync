## Task 1: QA & deliver Game Academy covers

### Steps:
1. Review each resized cover in Figma (check dimensions, cropping, logo placement, mascot accuracy)
2. Export final PNG/JPG files using required naming conventions
3. Upload exports to the designated Google Drive folders and update tracking spreadsheet links
4. Prepare a short summary for the team lead (what changed, where files live)
5. Send covers for review and log any feedback

### Resources and Links:
- Figma cover file
- Google Drive cover folders
- Cover tracking spreadsheet
- Communication channel with team lead

### Instructions:

Use a consistent checklist to avoid rework (size, logo, color, mascot). After uploading, double-check links from the tracking sheet to ensure stakeholders can access files. Note any feedback in the tracker.

### Steps:
1. Summarize Gemini vs ChatGPT behavior (strengths, weaknesses, prompt tweaks needed)
2. Note PixelCut credit limitations and alternative tools used (Firefly, Figma)
3. Capture the final cover-generation pipeline (prompting → generation → resizing → export)
4. Store notes in the shared documentation space (Notion/Doc)

### Resources and Links:
- Personal prompt notes
- Documentation workspace (Notion/Doc)
- Tool accounts (Gemini, ChatGPT, Firefly, PixelCut)

### Instructions:

Keep the doc concise but actionable—focus on what to do when Gemini drifts, how to enforce mascot gender, and when to switch tools. Include sample prompts and screenshots if helpful.

## Task 3: Monitor presentation feedback closure

3. Update status/CRM to mark the presentation as complete once approved

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:
