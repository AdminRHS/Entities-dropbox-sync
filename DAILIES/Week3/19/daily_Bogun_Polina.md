## Activities

### [9:00 - 13:00] - [Game Academy cover updates – image generation]
**What I worked on:**
- Continued updating Game Academy course covers
- Generated most new images in Gemini; monitored quality issues (mascot gender changes despite prompts/reference images, incorrect logo placement)
- Switched to ChatGPT when Gemini outputs drifted; ChatGPT was slower but more accurate
- Completed remaining cover images in ChatGPT

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I continued working on changing the covers for Game Academy courses. I generated the majority in Gemini, but after a while it started creating the wrong things – changing the mascot’s gender even when the prompt specified a woman, even with references and a detailed prompt. It also added logos poorly, even with references. So I went to work in ChatGPT; it turned out better there but slower. I finished the remaining images there.]


**Outcomes:**
- All required cover images generated (Gemini + ChatGPT)
- Identified AI-specific issues for future prompt adjustments

### [14:00 - 18:00] - [Presentation tweak & cover export workflow]
**What I worked on:**
- Received feedback from team lead: adjust one slide image in the onboarding presentation
- Edited/replaced the image via Gemini, updated the presentation, exported in required formats, and uploaded to the shared folder
- Resumed cover work: attempted resizing via PixelCut (credits exhausted on two accounts)
- Switched to Adobe Firefly for remaining adjustments, then standardized all covers in Figma
- Prepared to send final covers to team lead tomorrow

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[My team lead wrote to me and said he reviewed the presentation I made and asked me to change one image – basically fix it – and then I could export it in different formats and add it to the folder. I fixed the image through Gemini, replaced it in the presentation, exported in different formats, and placed it in the required folder. Then I continued working on the covers. I started putting them into the required format via PixelCut, but I ran out of credits, so I switched to another account and again ran out of credits, and it started producing not quite what I needed. So I decided to continue in Firefly, finished all covers, and in Figma I made them all the same size. Tomorrow I’ll send them to the team lead for review.]


**Outcomes:**
- Presentation updated per feedback and re-exported
- All covers resized to final dimensions (Firefly + Figma)
- Ready to deliver covers for review tomorrow

## Notes
- Gemini can drift on mascot/brand details; ChatGPT slower but more faithful
- PixelCut credit limits hit; Adobe Firefly + Figma now primary workflow for resizing
- Presentation fix completed; waiting to send covers for final approval tomorrow
