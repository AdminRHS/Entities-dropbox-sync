## Task 1: Apply Remote Helpers documentation templates

### Steps:
1. Open the documentation templates (analysis/sorting/organizing) and load today’s Remote Helpers project data.
2. Populate each section with the latest findings captured in daily.md, ensuring every task/activity is documented.
3. Review the filled template for accuracy and jot down any improvement ideas for the end-of-day observations log.

### Resources and Links:
- Remote Helpers template folder (shared drive)
- LG Nov25/Bindiak Dana/19/daily.md
- Project documentation notes

### Instructions:

Follow the same process used during the 10:50-12:00 analytics block—work methodically through each template component, validate data against actual activity notes, and flag gaps for the “template observations” task.

## Task 2: Review all working accounts for new activity

### Steps:
1. Sweep every communication channel (LinkedIn profiles, CRM inbox, Discord, email) for new requests or unanswered messages.
2. Log actionable items (follow-ups, call requests, training asks) directly in the CRM or daily.md with timestamps.
3. Respond or schedule responses, then mark each platform as cleared to maintain the “inbox zero” standard achieved earlier today.

### Resources and Links:
- LinkedIn working accounts list
- CRM messaging module
- Discord #vlg-messages + other workspaces

### Instructions:

Mirror the approach from 09:00-09:30 and 10:50-12:00: check accounts, capture positive replies, and ensure every thread has a recorded next step. Note any escalations for team leads immediately.

## Task 3: Create company cards and send connection requests

### Steps:
1. From job-site research and old-connection notes, list new companies/leads that require outreach.
2. Create or update their CRM cards with company details, contact links, and context from previous discussions.
3. Send LinkedIn connection requests or nurture messages, then record outcomes in the CRM and productivity spreadsheet.

### Resources and Links:
- CRM company card module
- Job-site tracker & old connections spreadsheet
- LG Nov25/Bindiak Dana/19/daily.md (12:00-13:00, 15:00-18:00 entries)

### Instructions:

Replicate the workflow from the “Job sites & legacy connections” and “Afternoon coordination” blocks—cards first, outreach second, documentation last. Prioritize re-engaged leads and team-lead requests, and track progress for bonus eligibility.
