## Task Tracking – Week 3 / Day 18

This file is used to track all tasks related to the `Week_3/18` work.  
Each entry should have a clear description, a date, and a status so it is easy to see what is planned, in progress, and done.

## Current and Planned Tasks

Use this section for tasks that are not finished yet.  
Add new tasks here whenever you start something new that belongs to this day’s work.

Include a short note if there is any important outcome, link, or follow-up.

## Discovered During Work

Use this section to log new tasks or ideas that appear while you are working (bugs, improvements, follow-ups).  
This helps you not lose track of them, even if you cannot do them immediately.

- **New task example**: _Describe any new task you discovered, with a short explanation and date._
