## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
Today's activities focused on preparing comprehensive onboarding materials for new hires. We successfully created onboarding instructions, developed a 30-question test covering various topics, and organized Dropbox folders with role-specific tasks for lead generators, designers, and developers. Additionally, we managed social media communications and scheduled an interview for Thursday. The onboarding structure is now ready for Monday's session with individualized materials prepared for developers and designers.
