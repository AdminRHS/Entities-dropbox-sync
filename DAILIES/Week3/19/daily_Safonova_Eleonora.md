[  Completed Tasks
Today I continued working on the visual part of the course and the structure of the promotional materials. I thoroughly developed the structure of the carousel layouts for the HTML course using ChatGPT: analyzed the learning content, identified the key points, and adapted them into a format suitable for slides and cover images for each module and lesson. Based on this work, I prepared the final short headline texts for each lesson cover, all in a unified style and focused on clear, engaging, action-oriented phrasing.
I also generated three banner variations for one of the modules and began exploring the visual direction for the course design. For each module, I prepared a descriptive overview to make it easier to convert the learning material into promotional format and consistent visuals.
I additionally worked on refining the Falcon mascot. I received feedback regarding the selected character, adjusted its positioning in the frame (slightly moved it to the side), reworked certain visual elements, and added floating code around the mascot as an extra visual detail that reinforces the course theme.
File and Content Organization
I organized all materials in Google Drive. I created separate folders for each module and, within them, separate subfolders for every lesson. I sorted all text materials into the corresponding documents and modules so that the entire content structure is now logical, ordered, and easy to use when creating visuals and writing prompts. At this stage, everything is fully organized and ready for further work.
Studying the Technical Requirements
In addition to the practical tasks, I started studying lessons and materials related to the correct preparation of visuals and animations: required formats and sizes for banners and carousels, technical parameters for animations, and the key goals and tasks that need to be addressed at each stage. This will help ensure that future visuals are prepared systematically and fully meet platform requirements.
Plans and Next Steps
Next, I plan to continue generating new banner options for the remaining modules and lessons, as well as begin creating animations for each module. Another major task will be writing and refining prompts for generating both static and animated covers and banners featuring the Falcon mascot, taking into account the feedback received and the selected visual style.
Carousel Structure Development
Today I carefully worked out the full structure of the upcoming carousels for the course. I reviewed the entire learning material, highlighted the key conceptual points, and adapted them for visual presentation. For each module and lesson, I formed a clear logic for how the information should be presented so it can be easily transformed into separate slides with strong visual accents. The structure was designed so that the material is delivered gradually, consistently, and in a way that is easy to follow in both horizontal and vertical formats.
Preparation of Final Cover Texts
Based on the course analysis, I prepared short, concise, and impactful titles to be used on the covers of each lesson. These texts were adjusted so they fit naturally into the design, remain easy to read, and function as strong call-to-action elements. All phrasing follows a unified stylistic direction so the entire series feels cohesive and professional.
Mascot Selection and Approval
We finalized the main visual character for all cover designs — the Falcon mascot. I considered its appearance, character, and stylistic features so that all future prompts revolve around the same character, maintaining a consistent visual identity for the course. When preparing the textual elements, I took into account that each image should reinforce the brand and engage the audience emotionally.
Creation of Initial Prompts for the First Module
I created the initial working versions of prompts for generating the lesson covers in the first module. For each lesson, I developed two formats: horizontal and vertical. The prompts include detailed descriptions of composition, background elements, visual accents, neon detailing, and the role of the Falcon mascot within the scene. These versions are still in progress — tomorrow I will continue refining them, adjusting the phrasing, improving stylistic clarity, and ensuring the highest level of visual precision.
Planning Further Work
I also outlined the structure for the next steps, so tomorrow I can continue preparing prompts for the remaining modules and refine those that were created today. It is important to bring all covers to a unified style and adapt them for different formats, so the work on the texts and visual instructions will be continued.  ]
