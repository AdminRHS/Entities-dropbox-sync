Making a research concerning the practice of Holidays days off due to temporary martial law in Ukraine:

In Ukrainian IT companies during 2025 and under martial law, the official state holidays as non-working days are canceled by law. However, most private IT companies independently choose to maintain holidays as days off for their employees.

Typical IT Sector Practice
Despite the official cancellation, many IT companies continue to recognize major holidays as days off, depending on internal company policy.

Common holidays often observed as days off include New Year’s Day (January 1), International Women’s Day (March 8), Easter Monday, Labor Day (May 1), Victory Day (May 9), Constitution Day (June 28), Independence Day (August 24), and Christmas (December 25).

Some companies offer flexibility, allowing employees either to work on a holiday with compensation or take an alternative day off later.

Flexibility and Holiday Days
The approach tends to be flexible; companies may let employees decide on working the holiday or taking it off, with some form of time-off compensation.

This flexibility supports employee well-being and work-life balance during ongoing challenges.

Summary
In the IT sector, while the state does not guarantee legal holidays as days off during martial law, private companies often voluntarily grant holidays off or allow compensatory time off, based on their internal policies. This approach is widely observed to maintain morale and a positive working environment.
In conclusion, for Ukrainian IT companies under martial law in 2025, the following holidays are most commonly preferred as days off by private businesses in this sector:

January 1 — New Year's Day

March 8 — International Women's Day

Easter Monday (date varies)

May 1 — Labor Day

May 9 — Victory Day

June 28 — Constitution Day

August 24 — Independence Day

December 25 — Christmas (Gregorian calendar)

Regarding December 31 (New Year's Eve), many IT companies often treat this as a part-time working day, allowing employees to work reduced hours or have flexible schedules to prepare for the holiday season, though it is typically not a full day off. This approach supports work-life balance during the busy year-end period.

This list and approach help IT companies maintain employee morale and a reasonable balance of work and rest in challenging conditions.

Made the actualization of employees available and employees work as of November 18 using Cursor AI tool and based on the employee public MD that is up to date as of November 18.

Made the research concerning the letter from the financial monitoring to Stas, found the solution and proposed the reply to it. Full text was sent to Stas as well as all the confirming documents.

Creating of the Markdown file that includes the information about performed calls by our lead generation managers but it will include the information about those employees who is still working. And it should include the information starting from January up to November 18 of this year.
For this purpose I downloaded a CSV file from Bonuses Google Sheet that is called library and it includes all the information about the calls assigned by our lead generators starting from January up to today.
Then I went to Cursor and asked it about creating a Barkdown file using the actual list of our employees C:\Users\rhs12\Dropbox\Nov25\Fin Nov25\Public\November 2025 - Employees_Public.md
As a result I have created the file where is the actual data concerning the calls assigned by the active staff C:\Users\rhs12\Dropbox\Nov25\Fin Nov25\Public\LeadGen_Calls_By_Month.md
