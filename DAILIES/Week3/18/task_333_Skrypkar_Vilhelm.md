### Steps:
1. Wait for Nikolay Artemchuk to schedule Design Department taxonomy training sessions
2. Make yourself available during scheduled testing sessions
3. For each team member testing workflow:
   - Be available for questions via Discord/in-person
   - Watch them complete first 1-2 steps
   - Provide guidance only when they get stuck
   - Encourage them to reference documentation first
   - Note any documentation gaps or confusion points
4. Document common issues or questions:
   - Create list of FAQ
   - Note steps that need clarification
   - Identify additional screenshots/examples needed
5. After each testing session:
   - Debrief with team member
   - Collect feedback on documentation
   - Update documentation if critical gaps found
6. Compile all feedback for Nikolay Artemchuk
7. Participate in documentation refinement based on feedback

### Resources and Links:
