## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**

Today's work focused on five main areas:
1. **Folder Organization**: Set up folder 18, understood week vs daily folder structure, created template files
2. **Team Management**: Processed GPT chat subscriptions, confirmed Polina's full-time status, discussed interview rescheduling, confirmed Yulia Shtepa's return date
3. **Project Status**: Reviewed Stas project situation, discussed Mosik project (attendance, payments, Maria's status)
4. **Holiday Planning**: Coordinated Khrystyna's time off request, prepared holiday schedule for clients, waiting for Kolya's approval
5. **Technical Setup**: Worked on video recording setup for AI tools tutorial, troubleshooting audio capture issues

Key learnings:
- Week folders are for archiving completed weeks, daily folders for current work
- Multiple projects need attention (Stas project decision, Mosik attendance issues)
- Holiday schedule needs approval before sending to clients
- Video recording has audio capture issues that need fixing
- Discord calls experiencing technical problems affecting multiple team members
