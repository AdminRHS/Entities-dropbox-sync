4. **Quality consistency across contributors** → Solution: Create and use quality checklist, peer review
5. **Prompt templates may evolve** → Solution: Track Discord updates, communicate changes to team

### Contingency Plans
- If documentation unclear: Schedule follow-up with Nikolay Artemchuk
- If workflow too time-consuming: Identify automation opportunities, discuss with AI Dept
- If quality issues arise: Implement mandatory peer review before library submission
- If team adoption slow: Create additional training materials, one-on-one coaching sessions
