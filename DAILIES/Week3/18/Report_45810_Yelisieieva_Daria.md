## Detailed Work Log

### Mosec October Invoice (Discount Applied)
- Verified days-off in Discord and recalculated individual October rates via `October 2025` → `Month` sheet, then posted totals to both `October 2025` and `November 2025` payment tabs (period `Oct25`).
- Duplicated the prior Mossec Solutions LLC invoice in QuickBooks (`niko@rh-s.com`), adjusted line items for Olena and Yulia discounts, configured banking/payment details, saved the PDF, and filed it inside the Mossec folder on Niko's Google Drive.
- Added the invoice link and send date to both payment trackers and emailed the client from the Mossec Gmail thread with a detailed breakdown of adjustments. Awaiting payment confirmation.

### Client Payment Monitoring
- Documented the Telegram-driven notification workflow: once finance chat reports receipt, identify the payment in the `November 2025` sheet, update Telegram with client/period, log the amount, switch status to “paid,” and record the receipt date in the payment tab.
- No payments cleared today; monitoring remains active for Mosec and other clients.

### Polish Accounting Follow-Ups
- Engaged Polish accountants across Telegram and `bmselfie` email after their reminder covering virtual office dues for Remote Employees and TyneSam entities.
- Action items: TyneSam payment handled via Niko Car’s private Polish account; Remote Employees invoice scheduled from the corporate account once funds are cleared.

### Culligan Water Payment (Poland)
- Logged into https://klient.culliganwoda.pl under the `pr.tynesam` profile, located the latest unpaid invoice, and initiated the transfer from the Polish private account.
- Ensured the client number `6626059` was included in the transfer reference to avoid reconciliation delays. Receipt archived with household utilities.

### Holiday Policy Research (Ukraine, Martial Law)
- Summarized 2025 IT-sector practices: although state holidays are officially canceled, most private IT companies still honor core holidays (Jan 1, Mar 8, Easter Monday, May 1, May 9, Jun 28, Aug 24, Dec 25) and often treat Dec 31 as a shortened day.
- Highlighted flexibility trends (work-for-comp-time, optional shifts) to support morale; findings shared for policy consideration.

### Workforce Availability Audit
- Used Cursor AI with the latest `November 2025 - Employees_Public.md` roster to validate which employees are active or available as of 18 Nov.
- Results circulated to ensure staffing decisions reference up-to-date availability data.

### Financial Monitoring Letter Response
- Investigated the regulator’s inquiry sent to Stas, compiled supporting documentation, and drafted the recommended reply.
- Delivered the final text and attachments directly to Stas for dispatch, clearing the blocker on that correspondence.

### LeadGen Call History Refresh
- Exported the Calls Library CSV from the Bonuses Google Sheet (Jan–18 Nov range) and merged it with the current employee list to exclude alumni.
- Generated `Nov25/Fin Nov25/Public/LeadGen_Calls_By_Month.md`, which reports call volumes per active lead generation manager month-by-month; file ready for finance review.

## Next Steps
- Track Mosec payment confirmation via Telegram and update the November payment tab upon receipt.
- Schedule the Remote Employees virtual office payment from the corporate Polish account once funds are confirmed.
- Monitor for any follow-up from the financial monitoring body after Stas submits the response.
