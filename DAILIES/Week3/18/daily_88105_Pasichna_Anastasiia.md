## Activities

### Morning - CRM Testing and Media Issues Discussion
**What I worked on:**
- Testing new CRM system
- Identifying bugs and issues related to media functionality
- Discussing improvements needed for media management

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

We tested the new CRM and found some issues. The issues are related to media - it needs to be redone because, at minimum, it doesn't work and cannot be deleted. We don't actually need tabs showing which language it's in.

We ask people to record English videos, and very rarely do we encounter other languages. Then they will make notes for us, they will make transcriptions for us, and they will make statuses and auto-populate "Employees" in the "Professions" tab, so it's automatically selected, because all people at our stage will be "Employees".

**Outcomes:**
- Identified critical media functionality issues in CRM
- Documented need for media deletion capability
- Confirmed requirement to remove language tabs from media interface
- Established requirements for auto-selection of "Employees" in Professions tab
- Confirmed workflow: English videos → notes → transcriptions → statuses
