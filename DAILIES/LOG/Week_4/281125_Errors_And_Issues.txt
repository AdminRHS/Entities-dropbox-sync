MODERATE ISSUES
================================================================================

Breakdown:
  - Work: 13 (16%)
  - Available: 14 (18%)
  - Project: 30 (38%)
  - Other: 22 (28%)

Exception Made: Used 3 "Available" status team leads (Vilhelm, Vladislav, Dana)
Workaround: Applied judgment to include team leads even if "Available"
Status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED
Recommendation: Clarify if "Available" employees should be used for assignments

ISSUE #M002: Department Code Mismatch
Severity: MEDIUM
Description: Employee directory uses different codes than v7.1 framework

  - crm → DEV (grouped) ✓
  - videographers → VID ✓
  - (no employees for AID, LGN, SMM, FIN, SLS as separate codes)

Similar Overlap: TSK-026 and EXECUTIVE-4 (daily report cycle)
Impact: Potential confusion in tracking
Decision: Merged in Master CSV - listed once with both IDs in notes
Status: RESOLVED
Recommendation: Standardize task ID naming convention

ISSUE #L002: File Location Pattern Not Validated
Severity: LOW
Description: Created file paths using pattern "Nov25\[Dept] Nov25\[Name]\Week_4\28\plans.md"
Issue: Did not verify if these folders actually exist in Dropbox
Impact: Assigned file paths may not be valid locations
Workaround: Used consistent pattern matching v7.1 framework
Status: UNVALIDATED
Recommendation: User should verify folder structure exists or create it

ISSUE #L003: Priority Logic Assumptions
Severity: LOW
Description: Made assumptions about priority based on deadlines
Logic Applied:
  - Friday deadline = HIGH
  - Monday/Week 5 = MEDIUM
  - Future = LOW
  - Tasks marked "CRITICAL" or "URGENT" in reports = HIGH
Issue: Some tasks may have different actual priority
Impact: Priority field may not match user's intent
Status: REASONABLE ASSUMPTION
Recommendation: Review and adjust priorities as needed

ISSUE #L004: Deliverables Count Estimation

  - TSK-020 → TSK-019 → TSK-021 ✓
  - DEV-EXEC-2 → DEV-EXEC-1, DEV-EXEC-3 ✓
Potential Missing: Implicit dependencies not stated in reports
Status: REASONABLE COVERAGE
Recommendation: Add dependencies during task execution planning

ISSUE #L006: 241125-261125 Tasks Potentially Missing
Severity: LOW-MEDIUM
Description: If reports 241125-261125 exist but were not accessible, tasks missing
Estimated Impact: Could be 30-60 additional tasks (assuming 10-20 per day)
Mitigation: 271125 report is comprehensive (1,504 lines) and may include earlier work
Status: UNCERTAIN

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY WARNINGS
================================================================================

WARNING #W001: Employee Directory Date Uncertainty
Description: Employee directory from "Nov25\Fin Nov25\Public\Employees_Public_Nov25.md"
Issue: "Nov25" could mean November 2025 general or specific date
Latest Date in Directory: Start dates include future dates (e.g., 2025-11-24)
Impact: May not reflect most current employee status
Status: USED AS PROVIDED
Recommendation: Verify this is most recent directory version

WARNING #W002: Mixed Status Meanings
Description: Status field has varied meanings
Values: Work, Project, Available, Part Project + Part Project, etc.
Interpretation: "Work" assumed to mean active full-time
Issue: Unclear if "Project" employees can be assigned tasks
Decision: Used only "Work" status + 3 "Available" team leads
Status: INTERPRETED
Recommendation: Clarify status field definitions

WARNING #W003: Profession vs Position Ambiguity
Description: Directory has both "Profession" and "Position" columns
Example: Profession="lead generator", Position="team lead"
Usage: Used Position to identify team leads, Profession for skill matching
Issue: Some tasks may better match profession, some position
Status: USED BOTH FIELDS
Recommendation: Standardize role definitions

WARNING #W004: No Task Completion Dates
Description: Completed tasks (TSK-012, TSK-013) have no completion timestamp
Impact: Cannot calculate task duration or velocity
Workaround: Marked as Completed based on evidence in 271125 report
Status: LIMITED DATA
Recommendation: Add completion tracking to task management

WARNING #W005: Cross-Department Tasks Unclear Ownership
Description: Many tasks list multiple departments (e.g., "DEV + AID", "HRM + DGN + DEV")
Decision Logic: Assigned to first department or department with most active employees
Example: "DEV + AID" → Assigned to DEV (has active employees)
Issue: May not reflect actual ownership intention
Status: BEST JUDGMENT
Recommendation: Clarify primary vs supporting departments
