## ASSIGNMENT CHALLENGES AND ISSUES

### Challenge 1: Missing Reports
**Issue:** 241125, 251125, 261125 reports not found
**Impact:** Potentially missing 3 days of tasks
**Resolution:** Focused on 271125 and 281125 comprehensive reports

### Challenge 2: Employee Status Ambiguity
**Issue:** Only 13 employees with "Work" status out of 79 total
**Decision:** Used "Work" status as primary filter, supplemented with "Available" for team leads
**Rationale:** Reports clearly indicate executive team + department leads involvement

### Challenge 3: Executive Team Not in Directory
**Issue:** Niko, Stas, Kolya Artemchuk, Olya mentioned but not all matched to Employee IDs
**Matched:**
- Kolya Artemchuk → Artemchuk Nikolay (37226)
- Olya → Kizilova Olha (178, CRM) - possible match
**Unmatched:**
- Niko (likely CEO/Strategic Lead)
- Stas (likely Executive role)
**Resolution:** Assigned executive tasks to Artemchuk Nikolay as confirmed employee

### Challenge 4: Department Code Ambiguity
**Issue:** Employee directory uses: designers, marketers, developers, managers, crm, videographers
**Reports use:** DGN, MKT, DEV, HRM, AID, VID, LGN, SMM
**Mapping:**
- designers → DGN
- marketers → MKT
- developers → DEV
- managers → HRM (HR Management)
- crm → DEV (grouped with developers)
- videographers → VID
- AID (AI & Automation) → No direct match (likely Niko's dept)
- LGN (Lead Generation) → Managers with "lead generator" profession
- SMM (Social Media Marketing) → Subset of marketers

### Challenge 5: Unassigned Company-Wide Tasks
**Issue:** TSK-024 (Comet Browser) applies to ALL employees
**Resolution:** Placed in Unassigned_Tasks.csv with Department_Code "ALL"
**Note:** Requires company-wide announcement

### Challenge 6: New Candidates Not in Directory
**Issue:** 11 new candidates interviewed 271125 not yet in employee directory
**Impact:** Cannot assign Employee IDs yet
**Resolution:** HRM-EXEC-1 task to send onboarding letters before directory update
