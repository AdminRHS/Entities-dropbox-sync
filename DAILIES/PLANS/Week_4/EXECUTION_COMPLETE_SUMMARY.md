## 📊 Data Quality Report

### Strengths:
✅ All task IDs captured from comprehensive reports
✅ Priority levels assigned based on deadlines
✅ Dependencies and blockers mapped
✅ File locations follow consistent pattern
✅ Detailed logs for complete transparency

### Limitations:
⚠️ 3 reports not found (241125, 251125, 261125) - May have tasks we missed
⚠️ Executive team partially not in directory - Used proxy assignment
⚠️ 37% of tasks unassigned - Need your manual review
⚠️ Only 13 "Work" status employees - Limited assignment pool
⚠️ Department codes mismatch - Directory uses different codes than v7.1

### Overall Assessment:
**MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE** in assigned tasks
- High confidence where employee explicitly matched
- Medium confidence in executive proxy assignments
- Requires review for 26 unassigned tasks

**PRT-NEW-001: Terminology Teaching Program** ✅ MAJOR WIN
- 7 comprehensive files created
- 529-line AI prompt with 9 templates
- Ready for content creation (Design + Video)
